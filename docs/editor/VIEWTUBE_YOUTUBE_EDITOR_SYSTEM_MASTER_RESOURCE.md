# ViewTube YouTube Editor System — Living Master Resource

**Status:** canonical living resource  
**Scope:** unified desktop + mobile video editor, editor UX, project portability, Remotion, AI generation, Editor Brain assistant, assets, templates, Studio Hub integration, widgets, analytics integration, skills, plans, references, branch donors, verification, and update history  
**Canonical owner / concern:** ViewTube Editor System integration authority  
**Date created:** 2026-09-24  
**Last audited main commit:** 56e2c0c03f83a168bf385dd2f71d32bc87166d08  
**Supersedes:** no specialized authority automatically; this document consolidates and indexes them. A specialized authority remains authoritative for its bounded concern until explicitly superseded here and in docs/DOCUMENTATION_REGISTRY.md.  
**Related authorities:** docs/domains/BRAIN.md; docs/architecture/VIEWTUBE_PROJECTS_CONTENTBUILD_WORKFLOW_MASTER_RESOURCE.md; docs/architecture/VIEWTUBE_ASSET_ENGINE_MASTER_RESOURCE.md; docs/architecture/VIEWTUBE_TOOLBOX_UI_MASTER_RESOURCE.md; docs/ui/STUDIO_HUB_COMPONENT_LIBRARY_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md; docs/DOCUMENTATION_GOVERNANCE.md

## 1. Mission

ViewTube should expose one editor product across desktop and mobile:

> One project model. One durable ContentBuild identity. One capability vocabulary. One Asset/Vault lineage. One Remotion render contract. One BrainRuntime orchestration path. Different adaptive layouts, never different products.

Desktop and mobile must be able to open the same project without translation loss. A capability that exists on one editor surface should either exist on the other surface or be explicitly marked as a parity gap in this document with an owner, plan, and verification target.

This file is intentionally editable Markdown. It is the editor program's shared source of truth between conversations, coding agents, implementation branches, audits, and future planning passes.

## 2. Mandatory update contract for every editor conversation or agent

Any conversation, agent, PR, branch, audit, prototype, or implementation pass that touches the editor system MUST update this document before the work is considered handed off.

Every pass must:

1. Read this document before planning or changing editor behavior.
2. Identify the current project/state/render/AI owner instead of creating a parallel subsystem.
3. Update the Current Work table when work is planned, started, blocked, partially completed, completed, or superseded.
4. Append one row to the Update Log. The log is append-only; never rewrite history to make work appear finished.
5. Add every newly created or materially used editor plan, reference, skill, standalone HTML file, branch donor, script, test, API contract, or external source to the appropriate registry below.
6. Record exact branch/PR/commit and verification evidence when available.
7. Mark anything inferred from a conversation or old plan as unverified until checked against current main.
8. If the architecture changes, update this resource before or in the same change as implementation.
9. If mobile and desktop behavior changes, update the parity notes and verify both surfaces.
10. If AI can mutate editor state, document the tool, permission, side effects, reversibility, approval behavior, and undo behavior.

### Status vocabulary

- planned — accepted direction, no implementation begun
- started — implementation or audit is actively underway
- partial — meaningful work exists but acceptance criteria are not met
- blocked — work cannot progress until a named dependency is resolved
- completed — acceptance criteria are verified with evidence
- superseded — replaced by a newer implementation or authority

A conversation saying something is done is not sufficient evidence. Completed requires code/runtime/test or equivalent repository evidence.

## 3. Current system architecture

### 3.1 Shared creator identity

The creator-facing unit is Project. ContentBuild remains the durable engineering identity underneath. The project, Video Package, editor state, generated assets, Vault collection, Publishing Package, and published outcome should remain manifestations of the same content identity rather than disconnected copies.

Primary authorities:
- docs/architecture/VIEWTUBE_PROJECTS_CONTENTBUILD_WORKFLOW_MASTER_RESOURCE.md
- docs/architecture/VIEWTUBE_ASSET_ENGINE_MASTER_RESOURCE.md

### 3.2 Editor state

The desktop and mobile editors must converge on the same canonical project/state contracts. Current mobile implementation visibly uses EditorStore under src/features/editor/mobile/state and current editor code already includes a bridge history for desktop/mobile state.

Rules:
- do not create a mobile-only project schema;
- do not add desktop-only effect or transition identifiers that mobile cannot deserialize;
- do not fork asset identity by device;
- maintain round-trip desktop → mobile → desktop fixtures;
- keep capability IDs stable even when layout differs.

### 3.3 Rendering

Remotion owns deterministic time, frames, composition registration, media composition, and final output. Current repository authority in src/remotion-editor is Remotion 4.0.465. The repository must not casually mix Remotion package versions.

Generative models create source media; Remotion creates deterministic composition, typography, overlays, captions, transitions, effects, data visuals, timing, and final render output.

### 3.4 AI

BrainRuntime remains the creator-facing reasoning and orchestration owner:
- src/services/brain/runtime/BrainRuntime.ts
- src/services/brain/runtime/BrainModelGateway.ts
- docs/domains/BRAIN.md

Editor UI must not call a model provider directly. The editor asks BrainRuntime for a capability; BrainRuntime gathers bounded context/evidence and returns explanations, proposals, or semantic tool actions.

### 3.5 Generative media

Video Director owns asynchronous generative-media job orchestration. Google Veo or any future provider should be added through the existing provider/job abstraction, not as an editor-specific provider stack.

Generated outputs must enter Asset Engine / Vault with provenance before they become durable timeline content.

## 4. Desktop + mobile parity contract

The feature set is shared; presentation adapts.

| Shared capability | Desktop expression | Mobile expression |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project + media | rail/library + inspector | page/sheet + visual browser |
| Design Library | persistent browser + filters | full-height visual library |
| Preview | central dominant canvas | highest-priority ratio-correct region |
| Clip/text/asset inspect | contextual inspector | contextual page/sheet |
| Timeline | large compound timeline | compact compound timeline |
| FX | catalog + inspector | same catalog in touch cards |
| Transitions | seam + inspector | same seam contract + touch editor |
| Captions/transcript | panel/workspace | page/sheet |
| AI Brain | contextual sidecar | dedicated page/sheet or sidecar where space permits |
| Generate | queue + browser | same queue + generation page |
| Export | export workspace | export page/sheet |
| Help | contextual explainers | contextual explainers + guided navigation |

Parity is about capabilities and project semantics, not identical pixel placement.

## 5. Editor Brain Hub Assistant plan

The editor needs a first-class assistant that can both teach and act.

### 5.1 User modes

**Guide mode — read-only**
- explain any control, panel, timeline behavior, shortcut, or editor concept;
- answer "where is..." and navigate the user to the relevant surface;
- start guided walkthroughs;
- explain error, empty, loading, disabled, and capability-unavailable states;
- use current capability registry and this resource so it never invents a feature.

**Assist mode — proposal-first**
- analyze the selected clip, range, scene, transcript, or full project;
- propose trims, splits, pacing changes, audio adjustments, caption changes, overlays, B-roll placements, transitions, and layout changes;
- return typed patches that can be previewed individually or together;
- require Accept / Revise / Reject before mutation unless the action is explicitly configured as safe and reversible.

**Create mode — generative assets**
- generate video, images, captions, subtitles, transcripts, title cards, thumbnails, overlays, visual assets, voice or sound assets where an approved provider exists;
- send media-generation work through Video Director;
- persist results through Asset Engine/Vault;
- insert results as candidate assets before making them final.

**Operate mode — semantic tool execution**
- open panels, focus selected objects, prepare exports, create caption tracks, organize assets, apply accepted editor patches, and launch supported workflows;
- mutating actions declare side effects, approval requirement, reversibility, and undo behavior.

### 5.2 Context scopes

The assistant should understand four nested scopes:
1. Selection — active clip, text element, transition, effect, caption, asset, or control.
2. Range / scene — selected timeline range and adjacent context.
3. Project — full editor project, transcript, asset set, settings, output targets.
4. ContentBuild / channel — durable project intent, package state, relevant analytics evidence, channel profile, and publishing context when permissions allow.

Context must be bounded and just-in-time. Do not dump raw analytics or entire conversation histories into every turn.

### 5.3 Target flow

Editor UI  
→ Editor Assistant Controller  
→ BrainRuntime  
→ semantic editor tools / typed edit proposals / media-generation requests  
→ user preview + approval  
→ EditorStore or Video Director  
→ Asset Engine / Vault when assets are created  
→ undoable editor state  
→ Remotion preview/final render

### 5.4 Initial semantic tools

- explain_editor_feature
- find_editor_feature
- open_editor_panel
- start_guided_walkthrough
- inspect_selection
- suggest_edit
- propose_timeline_patch
- generate_captions
- translate_captions
- search_project_assets
- generate_video_asset
- generate_image_asset
- insert_asset_candidate
- prepare_editor_package
- prepare_export

The tool catalog should be semantic and task-oriented rather than a large set of tiny getters and setters.

### 5.5 Mutation safety

Every AI mutation must:
- produce a typed patch or semantic action record;
- identify target project and selection;
- show intended effect before commit;
- be individually accept/rejectable where practical;
- enter normal editor undo/redo history;
- preserve project schema validity;
- never silently delete source media;
- never bypass user permission, provider cost disclosure, or external-write approval.

### 5.6 Help and onboarding behavior

The assistant should be able to:
- highlight the relevant panel/control;
- explain why a control is disabled;
- adapt instructions for desktop, mobile portrait, mobile landscape, keyboard, or touch;
- offer a "show me" walkthrough rather than only text;
- link to the exact internal guide/reference;
- explain keyboard shortcuts and touch alternatives;
- use contextual examples from the user's current project without changing it.

### 5.7 Assistant evaluation matrix

A release-ready assistant should pass tests for:
- correct feature explanations;
- no hallucinated unavailable features;
- correct page/panel navigation;
- desktop/mobile instruction parity;
- correct selected-item scope;
- safe typed edit proposals;
- accept/reject/undo fidelity;
- caption generation;
- media-generation handoff;
- provenance preservation;
- provider failure and cancellation;
- cost/usage display;
- accessibility-aware guidance;
- missing-data honesty;
- no direct provider calls from editor UI.

A detailed implementation plan lives at docs/editor/EDITOR_BRAIN_HUB_ASSISTANT_PLAN.md.

## 6. Generative Media: Veo + image generation

Current public-source research as of 2026-09-24 indicates:
- Veo 3.1 production model IDs include veo-3.1-generate-001 and veo-3.1-fast-generate-001.
- Veo 3.1 supports text-to-video, image-to-video, first/last-frame guidance, reference images, extension, supported aspect ratios, and synchronized audio on supported endpoints/configurations.
- Veo is a video model; still-image creation belongs to Google's image-generation family.
- Gemini 3.1 Flash Image is the current recommended general image-generation/editing route in the Gemini family; older Imagen 4 Gemini API endpoints were deprecated/shut down in August 2026.

Authoritative external sources:
- https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/veo
- https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/veo/3-1-generate
- https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/video/generate-videos-from-first-and-last-frames

- https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/image-generation
- https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/deprecations

Provider capabilities must be discovered and validated at runtime; model IDs and limits are time-sensitive.

### 6.1 Canonical media-generation request

A generation request should carry:
- contentBuildId and editorProjectId;
- purpose;
- prompt and optional negative guidance;
- target aspect ratio, duration, resolution and variant count;
- reference asset IDs;
- optional first/last frames;
- optional source timeline range;
- provider policy and provider/model selection;
- audio-generation preference where supported;
- seed or deterministic hint where supported;
- creator/user identity and permission context.

### 6.2 Provenance

Store:
- provider/model/version;
- prompt and prompt-template version;
- reference assets;
- source clip/range;
- seed/settings where available;
- requested and actual cost/credits;
- timestamps and job IDs;
- safety/moderation/error state;
- output asset IDs;
- selected/used/rejected variant;
- later outcome links when measurable.

## 7. Remotion integration contract

Repository state verified on main at 96a3cb13fcdfd36720aebd845e0ac5f7a5ab12c1:
- src/remotion-editor/package-lock.json pins Remotion packages at 4.0.465.
- src/remotion-editor/src/assets/QA.md explicitly treats 4.0.465 as repository authority.
- src/remotion-editor contains asset registry, composition, engine, cloud/player, transitions, captions/media, and render-related architecture.
- src/editor-design-library/integration/remotionAssetAdapter.ts already bridges design-library assets.

Rules:
1. Keep all @remotion packages version-aligned.
2. Upgrade only through a controlled migration with preview/final-render fixtures.
3. Use Player/preview for interactive editor playback and a server-authoritative final render path.
4. Keep frame-based deterministic animation.
5. Generated media becomes source material; exact text/graphics/captions/timing remain Remotion-controlled.
6. Add preview-vs-final frame parity fixtures before broadening AI-generated timelines.
7. Treat current official Remotion documentation and official Agent Skills as upstream authority when available.

Official sources:
- https://www.remotion.dev/
- https://www.remotion.dev/docs
- https://www.remotion.dev/docs/ai/skills
- https://github.com/remotion-dev/skills

## 8. FLOWSTACK + UI system rule

Editor UI work should use the repository's existing primitives, Toolbox/Subtoolbox system, and current FLOWSTACK/UI-review skills when they are available in the active agent environment.

Do not invent FLOWSTACK component APIs from memory. Exact package/version-specific implementation is blocked until the repository dependency or package authority for the requested component is inspected. If FLOWSTACK is only available as an agent skill and not a repository dependency, use it for design/review guidance without claiming a runtime dependency exists.

Primary UI authorities:
- docs/architecture/VIEWTUBE_TOOLBOX_UI_MASTER_RESOURCE.md
- docs/ui/STUDIO_HUB_COMPONENT_LIBRARY_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md
- relevant component-library source and tests
- this document's desktop/mobile parity contract

## 9. Skill and workflow registry

### 9.1 Editor lead skill

**viewtube-youtube-editor-system**  
Installed in:
- .claude/skills/viewtube-youtube-editor-system/SKILL.md
- .codex/skills/viewtube-youtube-editor-system/SKILL.md
- skills/viewtube-youtube-editor-system/SKILL.md

This skill is the lead routing and governance skill for all editor-specific work and requires agents to update this document.

### 9.2 Existing repo skills to reuse

| Skill | Role in editor work |
| --- | --- |
| viewtube-ai-system-governor | BrainRuntime, evidence, tools, generation, evals, anti-duplication |
| viewtube-prince-brain | Brain architecture/reasoning specialist |
| viewtube-skill-finder | choose smallest skill set before creating more |
| viewtube-solution-finder | search existing solution/prior art |
| viewtube-docs-grill | interrogate docs and stale assumptions |
| viewtube-verification-chancellor | verification/evidence discipline |
| viewtube-toolbox-builder | Studio Toolbox component work |
| viewtube-mobile-widget-system | touch/mobile widget composition |
| viewtube-widget-dashboard | Dashboard widget integration |
| viewtube-widget-dashboard-system | dashboard system-level widget integration |
| youtube-api-expert | only when editor work actually needs YouTube API capabilities |

### 9.3 Existing locked external skills relevant to this program

These exist in skills-lock.json but the external skill supply chain is explicitly unreviewed. Use only after reviewing the instruction content for the current task.

- ai-video-generation
- remotion-render
- captions
- subtitles
- transcript
- video-transcript
- YouTube Thumbnail Generation
- youtube-clipper
- youtube-seo
- youtube-tools
- ui-ux-pro-max
- ckm:design-system
- web-design-guidelines
- clean-code
- improve-codebase-architecture
- tdd
- prototype
- handoff
- review

### 9.4 High-value agent skills available in the current ChatGPT environment

These are environment capabilities, not repository runtime dependencies. A future agent host may not have all of them.

- Official Remotion skill family: best practices, markup, multimedia, interactivity, render, Studio, captions, SaaS, docs, upgrade.
- FLOWSTACK UI: builder, review, compose.
- UI Audit.
- Agent Skills: spec-driven development, planning/task breakdown, frontend UI engineering, source-driven development, TDD, incremental implementation, code simplification, accessibility/security/performance/observability workflows.
- Matt Skills Curated: skill-conductor, writing-for-agents, code review, research and specification workflows.
- Deep Research for current external capability/product research and source-backed benchmark passes.
- Visualize / data-visualization workflows for editor architecture diagrams, flow maps, capability matrices, and visual QA artifacts when useful.
- Plan and document workflows.

If a host lacks one of these, the repository skill and the official source documentation are the fallback. Do not block the project on a host-specific plugin.

### 9.5 Skill-installation policy

- Prefer an existing skill over a near-duplicate.
- Repo-local editor behavior belongs in viewtube-youtube-editor-system.
- Official upstream Remotion skills are preferred over third-party Remotion instructions.
- Do not silently expand skills-lock.json with unreviewed third-party instruction packages.
- Any external skill adopted into the repo must be source-reviewed, hash-pinned, dated, and logged here and in agent/registry/candidates.md or capabilities.md.

## 14. Phased implementation plan

### Phase A — truth and parity foundations

1. Establish this living authority and skill.
2. Audit capability IDs from actual code/tests.
3. Build one desktop/mobile capability matrix.
4. Extract shared FX and transition catalogs.
5. Add desktop → mobile → desktop round-trip fixtures.
6. Add Preview → final Remotion frame fixtures.

Exit gate: project state survives surface changes; shared catalog IDs are proven; render parity has fixtures.

### Phase B — editor UX consolidation

1. Compound mobile Timeline.
2. Preview-first responsive sizing.
3. Hidden-track recovery.
4. Unified Design Library.
5. Same navigation vocabulary and page IDs.
6. Selection-driven inspector.
7. Touch/keyboard alternatives and accessible target sizing.

Exit gate: feature parity with adaptive layouts, no device-specific project logic.

### Phase C — Editor Brain guide + proposal assistant

1. Add editor-specific context adapter to BrainRuntime.
2. Add Guide mode and feature/navigation knowledge.
3. Add typed edit-proposal schema.
4. Integrate preview/accept/reject/undo.
5. Add help/walkthrough anchors to UI capability IDs.
6. Add assistant evals.

Exit gate: assistant cannot hallucinate unavailable controls and cannot silently mutate editor state.

### Phase D — Generative Media

1. Verify current Google API/model limits from official docs.
2. Add Google provider adapter to existing Video Director provider registry.
3. Support text-to-video and image-to-video first.
4. Add first/last-frame, reference, extension and audio options only where current provider contract supports them.
5. Add Gemini image generation/editing.
6. Persist every output in Asset Engine/Vault with provenance.
7. Add candidate insertion into editor.
8. Share queue/progress/cancel/retry UI with widget/Studio surfaces.

Exit gate: no direct editor→provider call; every durable output has provenance and ContentBuild identity.

### Phase E — analytics, learning and advanced workflows

1. Add transcript semantic editing/search.
2. Add AI cleanup/highlight/Shorts recipes.
3. Permit analytics-informed recommendations through Brain evidence only.
4. Link accepted AI actions/generation choices to later outcomes where measurable.
5. Feed results into governed Evaluation/Learning, never direct unreviewed profile mutation.

Exit gate: evidence → recommendation/generation → creator decision → artifact/action → outcome → evaluation trace exists.

## 15. Verification and quality gates

For every relevant change:
- focused unit/contract tests;
- project round-trip fixtures;
- final render fixture where output changes;
- desktop 1440×1000 visual evidence for UI changes;
- mobile 390×844 plus relevant landscape capture for responsive changes;
- keyboard and touch path;
- undo/redo;
- empty/loading/error/disabled states;
- accessibility checks;
- provider error/cancel/retry tests for generation;
- provenance and identity assertions;
- no direct provider call from editor UI;
- no second project model;
- no new AI store or parallel Brain runtime.

## 16. Risks / ask-first boundaries

Ask before:
- changing canonical project schema or migration;
- changing ContentBuild identity semantics;
- changing Remotion package version;
- adding a third-party external skill to the repo without source review/hash pinning;
- changing OAuth scopes or external publishing permissions;
- introducing irreversible AI edits;
- adding a paid provider path without cost/usage disclosure;
- deleting old editor branches or reference artifacts;
- replacing a specialized canonical authority rather than indexing it here.

| Date / time | Agent / conversation | Branch / PR | Status | Work completed / begun / planned | Changed or created paths | Verification / evidence | New references / sources | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-09-24 | ChatGPT Phase A visual-frame parity pass | feat/editor-phase-a-visual-frame-parity-v2-2026-09-24 | started | Added canonical shared visual-frame contract for keyframe easing/evaluation, clip transform, crop and track ordering. Refactored mobile preview and final Remotion output to consume it; preserved track order through the desktop/mobile bridge; added focused deterministic fixtures. | src/shared/vtE1VisualFrame.*; mobilePreviewGeometry.ts; MobileProjectPreview.tsx; editorState.ts; editorDesktopProjectAdapter.ts + test; Composition.tsx; Phase A audit | branch is based exactly on main 2ce55f0... and currently ahead only; focused CI pending | Phase A parity audit + shared transition/FX contracts | open PR, run CI, repair branch-introduced failures, merge deliberately, then continue template/assets + audio parity and Phase B UI consolidation |
| 2026-09-24 | ChatGPT Phase A rich-parity pass | PR #410 / feat/editor-phase-a-rich-parity-fixtures-2026-09-24 | partial | Added and verified a rich desktop→mobile→desktop project fixture covering video/audio/overlay/caption tracks, layers, crop/transform/FX, keyframes, design-template clips, Remotion asset clips, audio metadata, captions, transitions, ContentBuild/legacy IDs, asset selections, generation provenance, and unknown desktop fields. Repaired editor-owned type debt in the render client, export ID narrowing, motion-keyframe narrowing, bridge fixtures, and desktop timeline adapter declarations. Fixed layer normalization so absent visibility stays absent instead of mutating to `true`. | editorProjectRichParity.test.ts; editorDesktopProjectAdapter.ts; renderJobContract.ts; ExportRenderPanel.tsx; PreviewPane.tsx; useDesktopProjectBridge.test.tsx; desktopTimelineAdapter.d.ts + test | runtime head `e2bea9e2...`: rich parity 4/4, editorDesktopBridgeRuntime 8/8, useDesktopProjectBridge 2/2, desktopTimelineAdapter 5/5; production-build/source-governance/local-smoke passed; static-quality has no remaining errors in changed editor files; remaining full/focused/static failures are existing unrelated repository debt | Phase A parity audit + canonical transition/FX contracts + PR #410 | merge PR #410 deliberately; next extract shared visual-frame parity for transform/crop/visibility/order and then asset/audio parity |
| 2026-09-24 | ChatGPT Phase A shared-FX pass | PR #408 / feat/editor-phase-a-shared-fx-2026-09-24 | partial | Continued after PR #405 merged (`052ff029...`). Added canonical FX catalog for blur/saturation/brightness/hue/contrast/sepia/grayscale/opacity; refactored mobile FX rack, mobile preview, Remotion final composition, mobile keyframe evaluation, and render-worker keyframe vocabulary to the shared contract; added per-surface capability truth so active mobile/preview/render FX do not masquerade as desktop parity. Fixed two branch-introduced FX typing/import errors after the first CI run. | src/shared/vtE1FxCatalog.*; EffectsLibrariesPanel.tsx; MobileProjectPreview.tsx; mobilePreviewGeometry.ts; Composition.tsx; vt-e1-render-server.mjs; editorCapabilities.ts + test | run 36036825165 on runtime head `684464996...`: production-build, source-governance, local-smoke passed; new FX catalog tests 5/5 and capability tests 3/3 passed; static/full/focused remained red only on pre-existing main debt, with no errors in the FX-changed files | canonical FX contract + Phase A parity audit + PR #408 | merge PR #408 deliberately; next add rich whole-project round-trip fixture and bounded editor typing debt fixes |
| 2026-09-24 | ChatGPT Phase A editor parity pass | feat/editor-phase-a-parity-foundations-2026-09-24 | started | Audited current capability/timeline/bridge/transition architecture; created canonical transition catalog; unified mobile transition UI, browser presentation mapping, final Remotion transition math, and worker accepted IDs; normalized desktop layers for mobile; expanded full-project bridge fingerprinting; added desktop→mobile→desktop and transition frame fixtures. | src/shared/vtE1TransitionCatalog.*; src/shared/vtE1TransitionFrame.*; editorDesktopProjectAdapter*; editorDesktopBridgeRuntime*; PanelBodies.tsx; EditorControlManifest.tsx; transitionPresentations.tsx; Composition.tsx; vt-e1-render-server.mjs; Phase A audit doc | source-level audit against main 4a273685...; targeted fixtures committed, CI pending | docs/editor/EDITOR_PHASE_A_PARITY_FOUNDATIONS_AUDIT_2026-09-24.md | open PR, run release gates, repair branch-introduced failures, then build shared FX catalog |
| 2026-09-24 | ChatGPT editor-system living authority pass | feature/editor-system-living-authority-2026-09-24 | started | Created canonical living editor resource; planned Brain Hub assistant; created editor skill and cross-agent update contract; indexed research, skills, branches and references | docs/editor/VIEWTUBE_YOUTUBE_EDITOR_SYSTEM_MASTER_RESOURCE.md and linked files | main baseline 96a3cb13fcdfd36720aebd845e0ac5f7a5ab12c1; GitHub source/branch searches; Deep Research source audit | official Remotion + Google Veo/Gemini docs; current repo authorities | open PR, review, then begin Phase A |
| 2026-09-24 | ChatGPT editor-system living authority pass | PR #400 / feature/editor-system-living-authority-2026-09-24 | partial | Opened PR #400; verified exact 50-item backlog and identical 196-line skill mirrors; added Gemini, Copilot and Cursor editor-authority pointers. Release gates are in progress. Vercel preview failed only because the project exceeded the free daily deployment quota, so no preview evidence is claimed. | GEMINI.md; .github/copilot-instructions.md; .cursor/rules/viewtube-youtube-editor-system.mdc; master resource status | GitHub compare: branch ahead 13 before final pointer commits and behind 0; PR mergeable; structural document/skill checks passed; runtime code unchanged | PR #400; Vercel quota comment; agent distribution targets from Herald contract | wait for release gates, refresh PR status, then merge if gates allow |
| 2026-09-24 | ChatGPT editor-system living authority pass | PR #400 / feature/editor-system-living-authority-2026-09-24 | partial | Release gates completed. Production build, source-governance, and local-smoke passed. Full-suite, focused-contracts, and static-quality remained red; the latest integrated PR-head baseline (`c075e3bb...`, parent of main merge `96a3cb13...`) showed the same gate pattern, so these are existing repository debts rather than failures introduced by this docs/agent-guidance-only branch. Vercel preview remained unavailable because the daily free deployment quota was exceeded. | master resource status; PR #400 evidence | Current branch changes are documentation/agent guidance/skills only; latest baseline and PR #400 both pass build/governance/smoke and fail the same three debt gates | GitHub Actions run 36031118522; baseline run 36011979615; PR #400; Vercel quota comment | merge PR #400 deliberately; begin Phase A capability/parity audit |
| 2026-09-24 | Docs consolidation Wave 6 | docs/consolidation-wave6-auth-editor-deploy-guide-2026-09-24 | current-state refresh | Re-audited editor authority against main 2efe0f56eb52c1029c71543291cf65e2b1a2245f; confirmed VT_E1 mounts useDesktopProjectBridge; promoted unique template-inspector/direct-selection/measured-preview donor requirements into Current Work; demoted completed recovery/donor docs | editor master + related editor docs | code search/fetch against audited main; no runtime changes in this wave | current bridge/runtime source; prior donor docs | continue Phase A/B parity and certify remaining template/preview gaps |

## 19. Editor page feature opportunity intake — 2026-09-27

**Canonical catalog:** \`docs/architecture/PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE.md#editor-opportunities\`  
**Status:** OPPORTUNITY / FUTURE DEVELOPMENT INPUT.

1. **IDEA-EDIT-001 — AI Rough Cut:** propose an initial assembly from script/narration/media/scenes with creator approval.
2. **IDEA-EDIT-002 — Script-Synchronized Timeline:** bind timeline ranges to script/narration/scenes/evidence/source assets.
3. **IDEA-EDIT-003 — Smart B-Roll Manager:** identify coverage gaps and route to Vault or governed generation with provenance.
4. **IDEA-EDIT-004 — Scene Inspector:** one scene-level view for script, assets, prompts, camera, audio, captions, effects, sources and alternatives.
5. **IDEA-EDIT-005 — Timeline Intelligence:** detect pacing/dead-space/missing-media/static-section/audio-gap/duplicate-footage/placeholder issues.
6. **IDEA-EDIT-006 — Version Branching:** alternate cuts/versions sharing canonical project/assets rather than cloned project universes.
7. **IDEA-EDIT-007 — Visual Style System:** reusable project-level typography, color, motion, captions, transitions, overlays, grain and framing.
8. **IDEA-EDIT-008 — Remotion Component Browser:** governed reusable animated components/charts/maps/lower-thirds/timelines/backgrounds/diagrams.
9. **IDEA-EDIT-009 — AI Edit Assistant:** BrainRuntime edit proposals with preview/diff/approval before mutation.
10. **IDEA-EDIT-010 — Automated Quality Control:** pre-render validation for assets, clipping, blank frames, silence, caption overflow, safe crops, transitions, ratios and render config.

### Editor integration rule

All proposals preserve the existing project bridge, one editor project model, ContentBuild/asset identity, deterministic render parity, undo/redo and explicit AI approval boundaries. AI UI must not call providers directly. Generated/recommended artifacts enter canonical provenance/asset flows.
