> **MIGRATION NOTICE — 2026-09-26:** Canonical machine-readable documentation metadata now lives in `docs/registry.json`. This Markdown file remains the preserved Wave 1 baseline inventory and audit source until a generated human registry replaces it; do not use it to override newer registry entries.

# ViewTube Documentation Registry

**Wave:** Docs consolidation Wave 1  
**Baseline commit:** `f3da5100d49304fcd196a322fd00574656b01ece`  
**Baseline inventory:** **119 pre-existing files** under `/docs`  
**Audit date:** 2026-09-24  
**Purpose:** classify the existing documentation before any move, merge, archive, or deletion.

> This registry is an audit map, not a destructive migration. Wave 1 does not move or delete any baseline file. `review` means authority is intentionally unresolved until the owning domain is checked against current code and tests.

## Lifecycle vocabulary

| Lifecycle | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `canonical` | Explicit current authority for a bounded concern. |
| `active-plan` | Plan/work order with work that may still be open; status must be verified before archive. |
| `reference` | Useful durable context, implementation notes, contracts, schemas, or supporting data that are not the primary authority. |
| `evidence` | Status, QA, acceptance, snapshot, baseline, or changelog evidence. |
| `historical` | Older generation retained for provenance; should not override current authority. |
| `artifact` | Herald output, screenshot, demo, or prototype evidence. |
| `retirement-candidate` | Low-value/transient document that can be removed only after reference/unique-content verification. |
| `review` | Potential authority conflict or stale/current ambiguity that requires code-backed reconciliation. |

## Explicit current authorities identified in Wave 1

- `docs/analytics/VIEWTUBE_ANALYTICS_VT_SYNC_MASTER_RESOURCE.md` — Canonical living Analytics / VT-SYNC architecture and migration authority created in Wave 4.
- `docs/ui/STUDIO_HUB_COMPONENT_LIBRARY_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md` — Current Studio Hub component-library presentation and primitive-correction authority.
- `docs/architecture/VIEWTUBE_PROJECTS_CONTENTBUILD_WORKFLOW_MASTER_RESOURCE.md` — Living cross-system Project/ContentBuild workflow authority referenced by CLAUDE.md.
- `docs/architecture/VIEWTUBE_ASSET_ENGINE_MASTER_RESOURCE.md` — Canonical Asset Engine product/architecture reference referenced by CLAUDE.md.
- `docs/brain/VIEWTUBE_AI_SYSTEMS_MASTER_RESOURCE.md` — Canonical AI systems management / agent-orientation authority. Coordinates current status, work claims, cross-system ownership and provenance without replacing bounded runtime/data/domain owners.
- `docs/brain/UNIFIED_AI_SYSTEM_CANONICAL_CONSOLIDATION_CONTRACT_2026-09-17.md` — Canonical living AI / Brain runtime architecture authority, reconciled against current runtime/evidence/evaluation systems in Wave 5.

- `docs/architecture/VIEWTUBE_TOOLBOX_UI_MASTER_RESOURCE.md` — Canonical production Toolbox/Subtoolbox design-system authority reconciled in Wave 3.
- `docs/architecture/VIEWTUBE_ONE_GOAL_COMPLETION_OPERATING_SYSTEM.md` — Cross-domain living completion/audit/status/agent-handoff entry point. It coordinates but does not replace scoped domain masters.

- `docs/architecture/SIMPLE_AUTH_V1.md` — Canonical living browser auth/session authority reconciled in Wave 6.
- `docs/editor/VIEWTUBE_YOUTUBE_EDITOR_SYSTEM_MASTER_RESOURCE.md` — Post-baseline canonical living Editor system authority.
- `docs/deployment/VIEWTUBE_DEPLOYMENT_RELEASE_MASTER_RESOURCE.md` — Post-baseline canonical deployment/release authority.
- `docs/user-guide-v2/VIEWTUBE_USER_GUIDE_V2_MASTER_RESOURCE.md` — Post-baseline canonical living User Guide V2 authority.

These authorities are scoped, not global. For example, the Studio component-library source-of-truth does not replace the Project/ContentBuild master resource.

## Post-baseline living/control documents

These files were created after the original 119-file baseline and therefore are **not** included in the baseline lifecycle counts above:

- `docs/README.md` — documentation entrypoint and authority map.
- `docs/DOCUMENTATION_GOVERNANCE.md` — lifecycle, authority, supersession, placement, and deletion-safety contract.
- `docs/DOCUMENTATION_REGISTRY.md` — baseline registry and consolidation ledger.
- `docs/analytics/VIEWTUBE_ANALYTICS_VT_SYNC_MASTER_RESOURCE.md` — Wave 4 living Analytics / VT-SYNC authority.
- `docs/editor/VIEWTUBE_YOUTUBE_EDITOR_SYSTEM_MASTER_RESOURCE.md` — living Editor system authority.
- `docs/editor/EDITOR_BRAIN_HUB_ASSISTANT_PLAN.md` — active scoped Editor/Brain implementation plan.
- `docs/deployment/VIEWTUBE_DEPLOYMENT_RELEASE_MASTER_RESOURCE.md` — Wave 6 living deployment/release authority.
- `docs/user-guide-v2/VIEWTUBE_USER_GUIDE_V2_MASTER_RESOURCE.md` — Wave 6 living User Guide V2 authority.
- `docs/architecture/VIEWTUBE_FINISH_PROGRAM_2026-09-24.md` — current-main completion/convergence plan; not a replacement for domain authorities.

## Consolidation progress

- **Wave 1 — complete/merged:** registry, entrypoint and governance contract.
- **Wave 2 — complete/merged:** Projects / ContentBuild / Asset Engine authority.
- **Wave 3 — complete/merged:** Studio UI / Toolbox / widget/mobile authority.
- **Wave 4 — complete/merged:** Analytics / VT-SYNC / Data Visual authority.
- **Wave 5 — complete/merged:** Brain / AI / Herald authority.
- **Wave 6 — Auth / Editor / deployment / User Guide:** Simple Auth V1 promoted to canonical; current troubleshooting/migration docs scoped; Editor master refreshed and donor requirements preserved; deployment/release master created from executable release tooling; User Guide V2 master created from live derived registries/governance tests.

## Next action

Wave 7 should perform archive/evidence re-homing and root cleanup: verify inbound references, move historical/evidence artifacts into stable archive/evidence locations where beneficial, delete only proven no-op retirement candidates, and produce a current full-tree inventory beyond the original 119-file baseline.
## Post-baseline editor additions — 2026-09-24

These files were added after the original 119-file Wave 1 baseline and therefore do not change the baseline counts above.

| Path | Domain | Lifecycle | Disposition | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| docs/editor/VIEWTUBE_YOUTUBE_EDITOR_SYSTEM_MASTER_RESOURCE.md | editor | canonical | retain-current | Living unified editor integration authority; owns desktop/mobile parity program, editor AI/generation integration map, skill/resource/branch registry and append-only update log. |
| docs/editor/EDITOR_BRAIN_HUB_ASSISTANT_PLAN.md | editor/brain | active-plan | retain-active-scoped | Implementation plan for BrainRuntime-powered editor guide/assistant, typed proposals, semantic actions, captions and generative-media handoffs. |


## Wave 7 AI archival update — 2026-09-24

The AI/Brain documentation family was re-audited against current main `c494d96aad9cbcf073e7d157685cb8b0269f123d`.

- Added canonical management/orientation authority: `docs/brain/VIEWTUBE_AI_SYSTEMS_MASTER_RESOURCE.md`.
- Preserved the runtime architecture authority: `docs/brain/UNIFIED_AI_SYSTEM_CANONICAL_CONSOLIDATION_CONTRACT_2026-09-17.md`.
- Preserved Prompt System Authority and Prompt Registry as bounded current authorities.
- Moved eight superseded broad AI audits/inventories/phase-closeouts into `docs/migration/reference/brain-ai-history/` after extracting durable rules.
- Added `docs/brain/ai-systems/AGENT_READY_REPORT_2026-09-24.md` as external agent-readiness evidence.
- Added `docs/brain/ai-systems/DOCUMENT_CONSOLIDATION_REGISTER_2026-09-24.md` as the deletion/migration receipt.
- Historical path entries in the baseline table now point to their current archive location; baseline counts remain historical Wave-1 counts rather than a claim about the present tree.
| 120 | `docs/architecture/VIEWTUBE_WIDGET_DASHBOARD_MASTER_RESOURCE.md` | architecture | `canonical` | `retain-current` | living | Canonical living coordination resource for widget/dashboard architecture, settings redesign, consolidation decisions, task backlog, state/preview policy, inventories, QA and handoff. |

| 121 | `docs/architecture/VIEWTUBE_MASTER_PRODUCT_TOOLS_WORKSTATION_ARCHITECTURE.md` | architecture | `canonical` | `retain-current` | living | Bounded cross-system authority for creator lifecycle, Master Tool taxonomy, tool/widget consolidation, product-level integration planning and current-code crosswalk; subordinate to scoped domain authorities for internal contracts. |

## Post-baseline system convergence program

- `docs/architecture/VIEWTUBE_SYSTEM_CONVERGENCE_AND_CONSOLIDATION.md` — active cross-domain convergence architecture. It coordinates consolidation of overlapping AI/Brain/context/evidence/intelligence/project/asset/operation/outcome systems into fewer canonical domains without replacing their bounded authorities.
- `tasks/system-convergence/plan.md` — execution sequence.
- `tasks/system-convergence/todo.md` — implementation checklist.
- `tasks/system-convergence/SYSTEM-CLASSIFICATION.md` — working KEEP / MERGE / PROJECT / ADAPTER / PAIR / QUARANTINE / REMOVE registry.

Destructive consolidation decisions require current-code reachability, donor-harvest and parity evidence. Historical documents are not removal authorization.
