# ViewTube Resource Library

This folder contains the canonical Markdown source documents that populate the creator-facing **Resource Library** at `/resources`.

## Authority

- The Markdown document is the editable content authority for each resource.
- The production Resource Library renderer is the presentation authority.
- PDFs, screenshots and future exports are generated derivatives and must not become competing content authorities.
- Research claims should retain evidence status, source provenance and review metadata.

## Current Collection

## Handoff

For the current implementation map, ingestion workflow, testing contract, known limitations, and next-agent instructions, read:

`RESOURCE_LIBRARY_HANDOFF.md`

## Template

Use:

`templates/VIEWTUBE_RESOURCE_DOCUMENT_TEMPLATE.md`

The template is intentionally semantic and creator-first rather than visually branded or developer-first. Every resource should explain the subject in plain creator language, show why it matters, teach how to diagnose or act on it in ViewTube, and move technical/API detail into optional advanced reference sections. The production renderer converts those structures into the ViewTube Toolbox/SubToolbox UI.

## Add a Resource

1. Research and author the resource as Markdown.
2. Start from the canonical template.
3. Keep the full research in the Markdown source.
4. Put one major concept under each `##` heading so it can become a SubToolbox.
5. Use tables for comparisons, checklists for actions and Mermaid for relationships/processes.
6. Add the source file to `RESOURCE_LIBRARY_ENTRIES`.
7. Verify search/filter metadata and direct `?resource=<id>` selection.
8. Run tests, typecheck, lint and production build.
9. Review desktop and mobile rendering before publishing.
