# Migration to /analytics (VT Sync) as the source of truth

**Status:** HISTORICAL MIGRATION PROGRAM / PR LEDGER  
**Superseded for current authority:** `../analytics/VIEWTUBE_ANALYTICS_VT_SYNC_MASTER_RESOURCE.md`  
**Wave 4 note (2026-09-24):** preserve this document for migration history, extraction decisions and old consumer inventories. Its August status snapshot and phase counters are not current completion truth. Current ownership/status must be read from the Analytics / VT-SYNC master plus production registries/code.

**Purpose.** ViewTube's analytics data, auth signals, and legacy Performance-Hub-era tools currently live across three parallel systems. This directory tracks the migration to a single source of truth: **VT Sync Local (`/analytics`)** for data, and a single unified auth signal for identity.

This document is the north star. Every migration PR is scoped from here. Every feature we discover during migration gets logged here so nothing gets dropped by accident.

## Status snapshot (2026-08-24)

| Track | Foundation | Consumers migrated | Legacy retired |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **analytics-canon** | ✅ Phase 0 shipped ([PR #34](https://github.com/themotionvisual/ViewTubeBUILD/pull/34)) | Intelligence Hub migrated locally; 34 legacy-importing files remain | — |
| **auth-canon** | ✅ Phase 0 shipped ([PR #36](https://github.com/themotionvisual/ViewTubeBUILD/pull/36)) | 0 / 48 | — |

Surgical unblock fixes already shipped so mobile users can keep using the app during the migration:
- [PR #33](https://github.com/themotionvisual/ViewTubeBUILD/pull/33) — GlobalDataProvider render storm (1,000+ renders/sec) broken by stabilizing `hydrateAuthStateFromAnalyticsCache`
- [PR #35](https://github.com/themotionvisual/ViewTubeBUILD/pull/35) — auth invalidation now actually clears the token; VerificationExplainerWidget hides when connected

## The five phases (per track)

Each track has the same structure. Consumer migration is the long tail — plan for a lot of small PRs.

| Phase | analytics-canon | auth-canon |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 — Foundation | ✅ `src/services/analytics-canon/` | ✅ `src/services/auth-canon/` |
| 1 — Dashboard | `useDashboardData` + `DashboardCanvas` widgets | `AppShell`, `AdaptiveNavigationShell`, `DashboardHeader` |
| 2 — Provider adapter | `GlobalDataContext.hydrateAuthStateFromAnalyticsCache` → vt-sync | `GlobalDataContext.authState.isAuthenticated` sourced from auth-canon |
| 3a — **Intelligence Hub extraction** | ✅ Embedded at `/analytics#intelligence` (own `ToolboxScaffold`), top-level `/intelligence` route + pageRegistry entry, canonical 34-dataset evidence + Brain persistence, PerformanceHub mount removed (governance test enforces) | — |
| 3b — **CSV pipeline extraction** | Surface CSV upload/detect/merge inside `/analytics`; preserve auto-detection UX | — |
| 3c — Tool views | Channelytics, MediaAnalyzer, HookGenerator, ThumbnailStudio, VideoPublisher, SEOGenerator, Subscribe, Settings | All 48 useBrain() consumers |
| 4 — AI / brain | `bootstrapFirstRunBrain`, `AIBrainCommandInterface`, `BrainCommandCenter`, `DailyAdviceWidget` | Same set — auth signals from auth-canon |
| 5 — Retire legacy | Delete `services/analytics/{DataStore,Selectors}.ts`, `SyncCoordinator.ts`, `coreLifetimeSync.ts`; delete PerformanceHub after 3a+3b land; loosen `vtSyncLocalIsolation.test.ts` | Delete duplicate auth-check sites; keep `unifiedAuth` as the auth *service* but not a consumer-facing API |

## Consumer migration surface

Real numbers from `rg` over `src/`:

- **48 files** call `useBrain()` (GlobalDataContext consumers → auth-canon targets)
- **34 files** still import from `services/analytics/{Selectors,DataStore}.ts` after the Intelligence Hub cutover (analytics-canon targets; recounted 2026-08-24)
- Overlap is significant — a file often needs both migrations, so grouping them per PR is efficient.

Priority order (from user-visible impact to internals):
1. Homepage — `useDashboardData`, `DashboardCanvas`, `WidgetRenderer` (26 widgets)
2. Nav shell — `AppShell`, `AdaptiveNavigationShell`, `DashboardHeader`, `AccountActionButton`
3. Core tool views — `Channelytics`, `PerformanceHub`, `MediaAnalyzer`, `HookGenerator`, `ThumbnailStudio`, `VideoPublisher`, `SEOGenerator`
4. AI / brain — `AIBrainCommandInterface`, `BrainCommandCenter`, `DailyAdviceWidget`, `bootstrapFirstRunBrain`
5. Utilities / editors — `EditorV1Page`, `StoryboardStudio`, `MediaAnalyzer`, `ProjectStudio`
6. Everything else in the 48 (peripheral widgets, settings screens, subscribe flow)

## Features worth preserving from Performance Hub era

Discovered by reading `src/views/PerformanceHub.tsx` (5,855 lines) and comparing against the current `/analytics` page. Items marked ⚠ are things the new page does not yet have.

### Table controls
- **Time-window picker** (7d / 28d / 90d / 365d / lifetime) — present in PerformanceHub, not visible on the vt-sync data table shell as a first-class control. `VtSyncToolboxDataTable` has `selectedTimeWindow` in state but no window picker in the toolbar. ⚠
- **Source-mode toggle** (api / csv / hybrid) — present in PerformanceHub. VT Sync deliberately dropped CSV as a separate mode (CSVs are ingested as bundles), so this shouldn't be recreated — but a "which source populated this row" indicator is worth adding.
- **Format filter** (short / long / live) — ✅ VT Sync has this in the table toolbar (`formatFilter` state).
- **Column filters per column** — ✅ VT Sync has this (`columnFilters` record).
- **Search across rows** — ✅ VT Sync has this.
- **Column pinning (left / right)** — ✅ VT Sync has this via `pinned` in `VtSyncTableColumnDefinition`.
- **Column visibility (show / hide)** — ✅ VT Sync has this via `defaultVisible` + toolbar toggles.
- **Sort by column** — ✅ VT Sync has this.
- **Export to CSV / JSON** — ✅ VT Sync has this via `exportName` and per-column `format`.
- **Row-level exclude/include checkboxes** (bulk selection) — PerformanceHub has patterns for this. VT Sync table needs verification. ⚠ (to confirm)
- **Metric availability coverage indicator** — PerformanceHub renders `MetricAvailability` per metric. VT Sync has `datasetFreshness` per dataset which is coarser. Worth mirroring per-metric coverage. ⚠

### Data-shape features
- **Hybrid API+CSV merge** (`mergeRowsForHybrid`) — deliberately not recreated in vt-sync. CSVs are ingested as bundles.
- **`VideoStatsVerificationSummary`** — PerformanceHub verifies "did the sync succeed? are metrics mapped?" and shows a health panel. VT Sync surfaces sync-run status but not per-metric mapping verification. Worth adding as a diagnostic dashboard within `/analytics`. ⚠
- **`buildTableMetricMappingStatus`** — PerformanceHub's "healthy / request_failure / missing_upstream / mapping_failure" per-table status. Same as above — worth mirroring. ⚠
- **`DatasetCoverageSummary`** — dataset-level coverage panel. Partial vt-sync equivalent via freshness. Worth strengthening. ⚠

## Tools / features to migrate (from user's list)

### Confirmed live surfaces (need proper migration)
- **PerformanceHub** (`/performance` → `src/views/PerformanceHub.tsx`, 5,855 lines) — the monolith itself. Big migration. Split into digestible sub-features.
- **Channelytics** (`/legacy/channelytics` → 535 lines) — old channel analytics view. Already "legacy" in the route path. Assess whether to migrate or delete.
- **MediaAnalyzer** (`/media-analyzer` → 655 lines) — asset/media inspection.
- **HookGenerator** (`/hook-generator` → 256 lines) — AI hook generator.
- **ThumbnailStudio** — route redirects to `/reference-studio/thumbnail-studio`.
- **SEOGenerator** (`/seo-generator`) — SEO metadata generator.
- **VideoPublisher** (`/video-publisher`) — publish flow.

### Deprecated / already re-homed (verify then delete)
- **Algorithm Architect** (`/algorithm-architect` → redirects to `/ai-brain?ask=algorithm-diagnosis`) — the route is a `<Navigate>`. The 345-line file `AlgorithmArchitect.tsx` may be dead code. **Action:** confirm no imports, then delete.
- **DashboardLegacy** (`/dashboard-legacy`) — kept behind a flag. Retirement candidate once new Dashboard is confirmed stable.

### The two critical extractions (per user 2026-08-24)

Both of these live inside PerformanceHub today. Retiring PerformanceHub without extracting them first would kill core features. These become their own migration phases, not consumer PRs.

**A — Intelligence Hub** (`src/components/IntelligenceHub/IntelligenceHub.tsx`)
- The AI-powered report generator. **This is where "Oracle", "Executive Summary", "Channel Report", "Algorithm Diagnosis", and "Keyword Analysis" actually live** — types in `IntelligenceHub/types.ts` include `OracleReport`, `AlgorithmDiagnosis`, `KeywordAnalysis`, `UltimateChannelReport`.
- Canonical owner is now the lazy, closed-by-default toolbox at `/analytics#intelligence`, mounted after the VT-SYNC data table and before Data Visuals.
- The Analytics boundary derives exactly 34 active datasets from `VT_SYNC_VISIBLE_TABLE_DEFINITIONS`, preserves source/freshness/unavailable states, and builds bounded evidence only when generation is requested.
- Scoped report history uses `vt_ultimate_channel_report_v1:{channelId}` and `vt_ultimate_generation_history_v1:{channelId}`. The old unscoped report key remains readable as a legacy artifact but is never attached to a channel or written into Brain automatically.
- Emit signal: `vt_generate_ultimate_report`.
- Report generation no longer imports `services/analytics/Selectors` or reads `yt_analytics_cache`. It consumes one pinned `CanonicalIntelligenceEvidenceBundle`, preserves the 12-section generation lifecycle and 14 rendered report blocks, and marks `/analytics` as authoritative.
- Before generation it consults channel-scoped Brain context; after generation it persists `BrainGenerationRecord`, `ChannelKnowledgeModel`, and `ToolContextPack`. Channel/snapshot mismatch rejects the write while retaining the report.
- Performance Hub no longer mounts a duplicate report generator; its Intelligence toolbox is a compatibility handoff to `/analytics#intelligence` while the rest of the monolith remains available.
- **Remaining gate:** authenticated real-data browser run and protected preview validation. Production promotion is manual.

**B — CSV Upload / Type Detector / Merge System** (5 files, 2,289 lines)
- [`csvImportDetector.ts`](src/services/csvImportDetector.ts) — 403 lines. Auto-detects CSV category from headers, returns `CsvImportDetection` with confidence + merge target.
- [`csvTaxonomy.ts`](src/services/csvTaxonomy.ts) — 983 lines. The full CSV family/type registry (upload types, families, tags).
- [`csvImportUtils.ts`](src/services/csvImportUtils.ts) — 380 lines. Import helpers.
- [`csvPackageIngestion.ts`](src/services/csvPackageIngestion.ts) — 526 lines. Bundle ingestion.
- [`trafficCsvMerge.ts`](src/services/canonicalSync/trafficCsvMerge.ts) — 197 lines. Merges CSV into vt-sync (already in the canonicalSync namespace).
- **Migration phase:** Expose CSV upload + type-detect + merge as a first-class action inside `/analytics` (probably next to the existing sync bundles). Preserve the auto-detection UX so users don't have to categorize their downloads manually.

### Types-only ghosts (verified — these ARE the Intelligence Hub's contents)

The types `OracleState`, `ChannelOraclePromptVersion`, `ExecutiveSummary`, `ChannelReport` and friends live in `src/types.ts`. They aren't dead — they're the report shapes the Intelligence Hub produces. Migrating the Intelligence Hub (item A above) is what preserves them.

### Deprecated tools (verified dead-ends)
- **AlgorithmArchitect** (`/algorithm-architect`) — route is a `<Navigate to="/ai-brain?ask=algorithm-diagnosis" replace />`. The AI Brain surface owns this now.
- **DashboardLegacy** — kept behind flag, retirement candidate once new Dashboard stabilizes.

### AI / brain surfaces
- **AIBrainCommandInterface** (`/ai-brain` → 1,171 lines) — the current AI brain hub. Absorbed the Algorithm Architect flow. Reads from GlobalDataContext (`authState.isAuthenticated`). Needs auth-canon migration and analytics-canon migration.
- **BrainCommandCenter** — separate view that reads useBrain(). Assess overlap with AIBrainCommandInterface.
- **DailyAdviceWidget** — AI-powered daily brief on the dashboard. Reads `authState.isAuthenticated`.

## How each migration PR should look

1. **One PR = one migration boundary.** Either "consumer X moves off legacy" or "phase Y foundation lands". Never both.
2. **Purely additive first.** Foundation PRs (`analytics-canon`, `auth-canon`) added namespaces without touching consumers.
3. **Consumer PRs delete legacy imports.** After Phase 0, every consumer PR should reduce the legacy import count. Grep `rg -l "from.*services/analytics/(Selectors|DataStore)" src/` before and after — the after must be smaller.
4. **Shape-parity test if new hooks are added.** Any new hook exposed from a `-canon` namespace gets a test in that namespace's `*.test.ts`.
5. **PR body links here.** The PR body always cites the phase from this document.
6. **Update this document.** Every merged consumer PR bumps the "consumers migrated" count in the Status snapshot table above.

## What to add to this document as we go

- Each Phase-1+ PR appends its name + link to a "History" section at the bottom.
- Every previously-unlisted tool discovered during a migration goes in "Tools / features to migrate".
- Every UX control we discover missing between PerformanceHub and vt-sync gets added to "Table controls" with a ⚠.
- Every consumer that turns out to be dead code goes in "Deprecated / already re-homed".
