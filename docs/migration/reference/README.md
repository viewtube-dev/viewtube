# ViewTube system reference — consolidated branch

**Current refresh:** 2026-09-03  
**Branch:** `codex/docs/viewtube-system-reference-2026-08-27`  
**PR:** #75

This branch is documentation/reference only. It is the consolidated evidence and architecture index for ViewTube's active development systems, migration decisions, donor branches, Brain stack, analytics/VT-SYNC work, editor work, anomaly intelligence, auth consolidation, Channel Intelligence/Algorithm workflows, and ViewTubeX/branch-check history.

## Start here

1. **[VIEWTUBE_UNIFIED_SYSTEMS_ARCHITECTURE_2026-09-03.md](VIEWTUBE_UNIFIED_SYSTEMS_ARCHITECTURE_2026-09-03.md)** — current master architecture: canonical owners, system atlas, shared contracts, integrated loops, PR/branch consolidation rules, target code spine, and unification roadmap.
2. **[VIEWTUBE_SYSTEM_REFERENCE_REFRESH_2026-09-03.md](VIEWTUBE_SYSTEM_REFERENCE_REFRESH_2026-09-03.md)** — current branch/PR refresh and how newer Brain, ViewTubeX consolidation, editor, and anomaly work changes older audits.
3. **[VIEWTUBE_DEVELOPMENT_STATUS_2026-09-03.md](VIEWTUBE_DEVELOPMENT_STATUS_2026-09-03.md)** — current Brain/tool integration state, Handoff Inbox, Outcome Ledger, PR #72 production chains, PR #78 anomaly foundation, and next implementation pass.
4. **[CHANNEL_INTELLIGENCE_ALGORITHM_WORKFLOW_SYSTEMS_2026-09-03.md](CHANNEL_INTELLIGENCE_ALGORITHM_WORKFLOW_SYSTEMS_2026-09-03.md)** — current Channel Intelligence, deterministic Algorithm Strategy and workflow-routing architecture from draft PR #79.

## Current application-development branches represented

- PR #72 — `themotionvisual/feat/brain-phase-five-production-chains`
- PR #77 — `refactor/viewtubex-clean-consolidation`
- PR #78 — `feature/anomaly-intelligence-foundation`
- PR #79 — `feature/channel-intelligence-algorithm-workflows` stacked on PR #72
- PR #66 — `feat/vt-e1-unification-2026-08-27`
- PR #69 — `chore/auth-pr-consolidation-audit`
- PR #75 — this documentation/reference branch

The reference branch does **not** authorize merging those branches wholesale. It records how their systems fit together and what should be harvested, normalized or sequenced.

## Consolidated architectural decision

Use current `main` as the application integration base, with the explicit sequence that PR #77 is integrated first; PR #78 is then rebuilt/revalidated on post-#77 main. PR #79 remains stacked on the Phase 5 Brain production-chain branch until the Brain branch sequence is normalized.

Normalize active work around these owners:

- **VT-SYNC** — raw analytics/API/import evidence
- **analytics-canon** — the only public analytics boundary
- **Channel Profile** — durable creator/channel knowledge and validated learnings
- **Channel Intelligence** — compact derived channel-specific context from Profile + workflow/outcome history
- **Projects** — project intent/workflow state
- **Brain** — orchestration, evidence reasoning and recommendations
- **Anomaly Intelligence** — derived detection of meaningful changes
- **Algorithm Strategy / Momentum** — evidence-backed action recommendations
- **ActionPacket / Handoff** — cross-tool work transport
- **Outcome / Evaluation** — recommendation and action results
- **Learning Ledger** — candidate learnings and promotion decisions
- **Video Assets / Vault** — canonical video/media identities
- **Tool Runtime** — execution surfaces with shared permissions and approval gates

The target loop is:

```text
VT-SYNC
 → analytics-canon
 → Anomaly / deterministic signals
 → Channel Intelligence
 → Algorithm Strategy / Brain
 → ActionPacket / Handoff
 → Tool
 → Outcome Ledger
 → Learning Ledger
 → approved Channel Profile learning
```

## Documentation rules

- New reference files should link back to the master architecture rather than inventing a parallel status authority.
- Point-in-time audits must be labeled historical after their assumptions move.
- Runtime branches remain separate from this documentation branch.
- Secrets, local account stores, private backups, generated caches and credentials never belong here.
- Standalone HTML/UI artifacts are reference/prototype evidence unless explicitly mounted in the application.
- The long-term goal is to derive documentation from canonical route/tool/system registries so docs cannot drift from product truth.


## PR #241 AI/Brain donor references — harvested 2026-09-24

PR #241 (`claude/ai-audit-content-optimization-gdwwp9`) is treated as a historical donor, never a wholesale merge source.

- [PR241_VIEWTUBE_AI_SYSTEMS_VERIFIED_AUDIT_AND_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_2026-09-12.md](PR241_VIEWTUBE_AI_SYSTEMS_VERIFIED_AUDIT_AND_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_2026-09-12.md) — preserved point-in-time reachability/AI systems audit. Historical counts and maturity ratings are superseded; audit methods and requirements remain donor evidence.
- [PR241_VIEWTUBE_AI_BRAIN_BRAINSTORM_AND_FRONTEND_DESIGN_2026-09-12.md](PR241_VIEWTUBE_AI_BRAIN_BRAINSTORM_AND_FRONTEND_DESIGN_2026-09-12.md) — preserved Brain/product design brainstorm including knowledge, style, asset, evidence, trace and autonomy surfaces.
- [../../brain/PR241_DONOR_HARVEST_AUDIT_2026-09-24.md](../../brain/PR241_DONOR_HARVEST_AUDIT_2026-09-24.md) — current 34-file disposition matrix and feature/skill harvest decisions.
- [../../brain/PR241_DONOR_HARVEST_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_2026-09-24.md](../../brain/PR241_DONOR_HARVEST_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_2026-09-24.md) — current forward-port sequence.

Current code/authority always wins over the 2026-09-12 snapshots.


## Brain / AI historical archive — 2026-09-24

Superseded broad AI audits, phase manifests and phase-closeout records have been re-homed under:

- [brain-ai-history/README.md](brain-ai-history/README.md)

These files are historical provenance only. Durable rules were promoted into the current AI Systems Living Master Resource and bounded authorities before archival.
