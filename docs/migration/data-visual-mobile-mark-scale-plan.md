# Data Visual mobile mark-scale plan

**Status:** ACTIVE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN — partially landed  
**Current authority:** `../analytics/VIEWTUBE_ANALYTICS_VT_SYNC_MASTER_RESOURCE.md`  
**Last re-audited:** 2026-09-24 against main `0c4610629bfba98ffc0703a42e422352d5f31514`  
**Current state:** the canvas registry now contains 8 production module contracts and mark-scale helpers exist. Per-module status tables below are historical planning checkpoints; verify each renderer against `DATA_VISUAL_MODULE_CONTRACTS` before treating a prerequisite as still open.

Follow-up to `data-visual-canvas-contract.md`. That work gave every migrated
Data Visual a bounded, predictable **canvas**. This plan addresses what the
screenshots then made obvious: the canvas is correct, but the **marks drawn
inside it** are still desktop-sized.

**Scope: canvas contents only.** Mark geometry, mark counts, default
selections, and how many sub-panels a canvas draws at once. Module chrome —
headers, titles, controllers, metric strips, footers — is explicitly out of
scope and must not be redesigned. Also out of scope: the global Toolbox and
SubToolbox systems, Studio Hub, Projects, Editor, generic widget primitives,
and unrelated Analytics layout.

## 1. The gap this closes

The canvas contract already carries `densityProfile` — *how many* marks may be
on screen at once. Three things it does not carry:

| Missing concept | Symptom in the screenshots |
| --- | --- |
| **Mark scale** — how big each mark is | Shorts Retention bubbles overlap into a single blob at 375px; Channel Progress bars are desktop-thick in a 200px-tall plot |
| **Default selection** — what the count control starts at | Engagement Pulse opens on 25 videos; Channel Vital Signs opens on *all* videos and *all 12* metrics |
| **Panel budget** — how many sub-panels share one canvas | Clock Burst draws two donuts plus two legends in a 358×201 portrait canvas |

Density, scale, selection and panel count are four independent decisions. A
module can need all four, and today it can express only one.

---

## 2. Contract extensions

Extend `src/components/dataVisualModuleContract.ts`. Every field is optional;
a module that omits one keeps today's behaviour.

```ts
/** Per-orientation multiplier applied to mark geometry. */
markScale?: DataVisualOrientationProfile      // radii, stroke widths, bar thickness, tile edges

/** Per-orientation starting value for the module's own count control. */
defaultSelection?: DataVisualOrientationProfile

/** Simultaneous sub-panels inside one canvas (donuts, stacked plot rows). */
panelBudget?: DataVisualOrientationProfile

/** Simultaneous series / metric traces. */
seriesBudget?: DataVisualOrientationProfile
```

`DataVisualOrientationProfile` is the existing `{ desktop, landscape, portrait }`
shape already used by `densityProfile`.

### Default mark scale

| Bucket | Scale | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `desktop` | `1.0` | Unchanged — desktop is the reference, never regress it |
| `landscape` | `0.6` | Canvas is ~510–537px wide, ~287–302px tall |
| `portrait` | `0.5` | Canvas is ~343–358px wide, ~193–201px tall |

Portrait `0.5` is the "halve the radius" instruction generalised. Landscape sits
between because the canvas is roughly 1.5× the portrait area.

### Floors — scale never wins against these

Scaling is a multiplier, not a licence to render illegible or untappable marks.
Every scaled value clamps to a floor:

| Property | Floor | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Interactive mark hit area | **24 × 24 CSS px** | Touch target; may be an invisible hit rect around a smaller visible mark |
| Stroke width | **1.5 px** | Below this, hairlines disappear on low-DPR phones |
| Axis / label font | **8 px** | Below this, uppercase heavy faces stop resolving |
| Heat / matrix tile edge | **10 px** | Below this a tile reads as noise, not a video |
| Bubble radius | **2 px** | Below this a bubble is a dot with no area encoding |

A module that cannot satisfy both its density budget and these floors must
**reduce density further**, never shrink below the floor.

### Shared helpers

Add to `src/components/dataVisualCanvasGeometry.ts`:

```ts
/** Active mark-scale multiplier for a registered module. */
useDataVisualMarkScale(id: RegisteredDataVisualModuleId): number

/** Scale one mark dimension and clamp it to its floor. */
scaleMark(base: number, scale: number, floor: number): number

/** Starting value for a module's count control in the active composition. */
useDataVisualDefaultSelection(id, fallback: number): number

/** Simultaneous sub-panels for the active composition. */
useDataVisualPanelBudget(id, fallback: number): number
```

`scaleMark` is the only place rounding and clamping happen, so a floor is never
re-derived per renderer.

---

## 3. Per-module specification

Modules already on the canvas contract are marked ✅. Two named modules are
**not yet migrated** and need the canvas contract applied first — that is a
prerequisite, not a separate project.

### 3.1 Shorts Retention ✅ `shorts-retention`

Bubble radii come from `buildLogBubbleRadii` / `buildLinearAreaBubbleRadii` in
`src/components/chartScaleModel.ts`, which already take `{ minRadius, maxRadius }`.
That is the seam — pass scaled values, do not fork the builders.

| Knob | Location | Desktop | Landscape | Portrait |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `buildLogBubbleRadii` min/max | `GraphsPageCharts.tsx` → `ShortsRetention`, `viewRadii` | `3 / 32` | `2 / 19` | `2 / 16` |
| `buildLinearAreaBubbleRadii` min/max | `GraphsPageCharts.tsx` → `ShortsRetentionWidgetModule`, `viewRadii` | `4 / 36` | `2 / 22` | `2 / 18` |
| `defaultSelection` (videos plotted) | `selectedCount` state (both modules init `100`) | `100` | `50` | `25` |
| Hover dot radius | `ViewTubeScatterBubble` callers | `6` | `4` | `3` |

`densityProfile` stays as registered. Add `markScale` and `defaultSelection`.

**Acceptance:** at 375×667 no two bubbles at the median radius fully occlude each
other; the largest bubble is at most ~⅓ of the plot's shorter edge.

### 3.2 Engagement Pulse ✅ `engagement-pulse`

| Knob | Location | Desktop | Landscape | Portrait |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `defaultSelection` (videos) | `EngagementLinesModule` → `useState(25)` | `25` | `15` | `10` |
| Line `strokeWidth` (selected / other) | `<Line strokeWidth>` | `5 / 3` | `3 / 2` | `2.5 / 1.5` |
| `EngagementSelectedDot` / `EngagementHoverDot` radius | `GraphsPageCharts.tsx` (`r={6}`) | `6` | `4` | `3` |
| `seriesBudget` (metric traces) | `ENGAGEMENT_METRICS` | `4` | `4` | `3` |

The existing `densityProfile` already caps *plotted* points; `defaultSelection`
changes what the control **starts** at, so the module opens readable instead of
opening dense and being clamped. Both are needed.

**Note on the count control:** changing the default changes the number the
controller displays. That is a canvas-driven default, not a controller
redesign — the control keeps its full range and the user can still reach 50.

### 3.3 Heat Matrix ✅ `heat-matrix`

| Knob | Location | Desktop | Landscape | Portrait |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ROWS` | `TubeExplorerThermalImaging` → `useState<5 \| 8>(8)` | `8` | `6` | `4` |
| Preferred `TILE` edge | `ThermalImagingModuleInner` | `36 / 58` | `×0.6` | `×0.5`, floor `10` |
| Column budget | `densityProfile` (already registered) | `18` | `14` | `8` |

The `5 | 8` union widens to `4 | 5 | 6 | 8`. Portrait currently clamps to 5 —
change to 4. Tile edge stays the `min(fromHeight, fromWidth)` calculation already
in place; `markScale` caps the *preferred* edge it is clamped against.

**Acceptance:** at 375×667 the matrix reads as 4 rows × ~8 columns of square
tiles ≥ 10px with the remainder reachable by horizontal scroll.

### 3.4 Channel Vital Signs ⚠️ `channel-vital-signs` — **migration prerequisite**

`TubeExplorerChannelVitalSigns` is not on the canvas contract. Register it
(`family: "temporal"`, `canvasAspect: "16:9"`, `overflow: "clip"`), wire
`canvasModuleId`, then apply:

| Knob | Location | Desktop | Landscape | Portrait |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `seriesBudget` (metric traces) | `selectedVitalMetrics` init (all 12) | `12` (all) | `8` | `5` |
| `defaultSelection` (videos) | `countIndex` init → `VITAL_ROW_COUNTS` | `0` (all) | `50` | `25` |
| Trace stroke width | `TubeExplorerChannelVitalSigns` trace render | base | `×0.6` | `×0.5`, floor `1.5` |
| Point marker radius | trace render | base | `×0.6` | `×0.5`, floor `2` |

Portrait takes the **first 5** of `CHANNEL_VITAL_METRICS` — views, engaged views,
watch time, subscribers, revenue. That ordering is already the array's priority
order, so no new ranking is introduced. `VITAL_ROW_COUNTS` already contains
`25` and `50`; `defaultSelection` selects the index, it does not add options.

### 3.5 Publish Optimal Clock ✅ `publish-optimal-clock`

Portrait already folds 24 hourly columns into 12 two-hour bands. The remaining
problem is **how the cells are drawn**, not how many.

Today the grid is 168 individual `<div>` elements, each with its own border,
border-radius, transition and hover transform. At portrait cell sizes (~23 × 14
px) the 1px borders and 2px radii consume a visible fraction of each cell, and
168 transitioning nodes is the heaviest paint in the visual set.

**Replace the DOM grid with a single `<svg>`** sized to the plot box: one `<rect>`
per cell, one shared hover overlay rect, labels as `<text>`. This is what "use a
grid system instead of individual rectangles" should mean here — it is a
rendering change, not a layout change, and the visual design is preserved.

| Knob | Desktop | Landscape | Portrait |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Columns (hour bands) | `24` | `24` | `12` |
| Cell stroke | `1` | `0.75` | `0.5` |
| Cell corner radius | `2` | `1.5` | `1` |
| Hour-label font | `9` | `9` | `8` (floor) |

Keep the existing keyboard focus and `aria-label` per cell — move them onto the
`<rect>` elements; do not lose them in the port.

### 3.6 Channel Progress ⚠️ `channel-progress` — **migration prerequisite**

`ComboChannelProgress` is not on the canvas contract. Register it
(`family: "temporal"`, `canvasAspect: "16:9"`), wire the canvas, then apply.

This module already scales its marks by **metric count** — that ladder is the
pattern to extend, multiplying each rung by `markScale`:

| Knob | Location | Desktop | Landscape | Portrait |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `barSize` (1 / 2 / n metrics) | `renderChartForMetrics` → `const barSize =` | `46 / 23 / calc` | `×0.6` | `×0.5` |
| `barSize` (individual grid) | same | `28` | `17` | `14` |
| `darkLineWidth` ladder | `renderChartForMetrics` | `8 … 3` | `×0.6`, floor `1.5` | `×0.5`, floor `1.5` |
| `dotRadius` ladder | `renderChartForMetrics` | `6 … 3.5` | `×0.6`, floor `2` | `×0.5`, floor `2` |
| `dotStrokeWidth` ladder | `renderChartForMetrics` | `3 … 2` | `×0.6`, floor `1.5` | `×0.5`, floor `1.5` |
| `seriesBudget` (overlaid metrics) | `selectedMetrics` | `5` | `3` | `2` |
| `panelBudget` (individual-grid rows) | `isIndividualGrid` rows | `5` | `3` | `2` |

> **Open question — flag before implementing.** "Maximum bar height has to be
> about 1/2 or 1/3 the desktop version" is ambiguous against this code. In a
> vertical bar chart, recharts' `barSize` is bar *thickness*; bar *height* is the
> data value mapped to the plot. This plan reads the instruction as **bar
> thickness × 0.5 (portrait) / 0.6 (landscape)**, since the plot height already
> halves with the 16:9 canvas. If the intent was instead "the tallest bar should
> occupy only ½–⅓ of the plot height", that is a Y-domain change (headroom
> multiplier), not a mark-scale change — say so and it becomes a one-line
> `buildAdaptiveZeroScale` adjustment instead.

### 3.7 Clock Burst ✅ `clock-radial-burst`

Portrait currently draws both donuts side by side (each ~165px wide) plus both
legends. Halving each donut is the wrong answer — the right answer is **one
panel at a time**.

| Knob | Desktop | Landscape | Portrait |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `panelBudget` (donut + its legend) | `2` | `2` | `1` |
| Donut label font | `12` | `10` | `8` (floor) |
| Slice stroke | `3` | `2` | `1.5` (floor) |

At `panelBudget: 1` the canvas shows **one donut plus its own legend**, with a
segmented switch between `TRAFFIC SOURCES` and the active source's detail. The
switch is canvas-internal (a two-item control inside the evidence area), not a
module controller — it is how the canvas presents a panel it cannot fit, which
keeps this inside scope.

Hiding a panel behind a switch is not removing information; silently clipping it
is. Landscape keeps both panels — at 537 × 302 two square plots still clear the
floors.

### 3.8 Content Treemap ✅ `content-treemap`

Pillar count is already budgeted (12 / 9 / 6). Remaining work is label legibility:

- `TREEMAP_LABEL_EM_WIDTH` fitting stays; add a **minimum tile area** below which
  the tile drops its stat line and shows the label alone, and below which it
  shows neither (colour + hover only).
- Tile border `2` → `1.5` landscape, `1` portrait.
- Corner radius `9` → `6` landscape, `4` portrait.

### 3.9 Traffic Source Evolution ✅ `traffic-source-evolution`

Axis-tick thinning is done. Add:

- Area stroke width `×markScale`, floor `1.5`.
- `seriesBudget`: `8 / 6 / 4` visible source bands; the remainder folds into an
  "OTHER" band rather than being dropped.

---

## 4. Sweep: the remaining Data Visuals

`TUBE_EXPLORER_VISUAL_MODULES` holds 46 entries and most route through four
shared renderers. Fixing those four covers the long tail without 40 separate
migrations:

| Shared renderer | Location | Mark knobs to scale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `VideoScatter` | `TubeExplorerVisualModules.tsx` | point radius, stroke, label font |
| `HeatGrid` | same file | `grid-cols-7` → `4` portrait / `5` landscape; border `3` → scaled; label / value font |
| `Donut` | same file | radius, slice stroke, label font |
| `TrafficBars` | same file | `slice(0, 16)` → `densityProfile`; bar thickness, label font |
| `createModule` | same file | pass `canvasModuleId` through so every wrapped module inherits the contract |

Order the sweep by family — temporal, spatial, radial, natural — and register a
contract per module as it is touched. `createModule` is the highest-leverage
single change: it wraps roughly half the registry.

---

## 5. Audit harness additions

`scripts/capture-data-visual-mobile-audit.mjs` currently asserts *canvas*
geometry. Extend it to assert *mark* geometry, so mark regressions fail CI the
same way canvas regressions do.

Per visual, per viewport, measure and assert:

| Assertion | Fails when |
| --- | --- |
| Smallest interactive mark ≥ 24 × 24 CSS px | A tap target shrank below the touch floor |
| No rendered text below 8px computed font-size | A label was scaled into illegibility |
| Mark count ≤ `densityProfile[bucket]` | A renderer ignored its density budget |
| Visible sub-panels ≤ `panelBudget[bucket]` | A canvas drew more panels than it can fit |
| Median mark spacing > 0 for scatter families | Bubbles collapsed into a single blob |

Emit a `mark-metrics.json` beside `manifest.json` recording measured mark counts,
smallest/median/largest mark size and smallest font per visual per viewport, so a
change in mark density is reviewable as a diff rather than by eye.

Keep the existing rule: **a visual is not fixed until its own rendered screenshot
has been inspected.**

---

## 6. Order of work

Each phase is independently shippable and leaves unmigrated modules untouched.

| Phase | Work | Why this order |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | ✅ Contract fields, `scaleMark`, the hooks, floors table, unit tests | Nothing else can be expressed until the vocabulary exists |
| **2** | ✅ Harness mark assertions + `mark-metrics.json` | Land the ruler before moving anything, so phase 3+ is measured, not asserted |
| **3** | ✅ Already-migrated modules: Shorts Retention, Engagement Pulse, Heat Matrix, Clock Burst, Content Treemap, Traffic Source Evolution | Contract already wired; lowest risk; proves the vocabulary |
| **4** | Publish Optimal Clock SVG port | Isolated rendering change, own PR — easiest to review and revert alone |
| **5** | Channel Vital Signs + Channel Progress: canvas migration, then mark scale | Two steps in one module each; migrate first, verify, then scale |
| **6** | Shared-renderer sweep via `createModule`, `VideoScatter`, `HeatGrid`, `Donut`, `TrafficBars` | Highest leverage, but only once the pattern is proven on named modules |

---

## 7. Acceptance criteria

For every Data Visual, at 375 × 667, 390 × 844, 667 × 375, 844 × 390 and
1440 × 900:

- Marks are sized for the canvas they are in, not scaled-down desktop marks.
- No mark falls below its floor; where density and floors conflict, **density
  gives way**.
- Every count control opens at a value that is readable in that composition.
- No canvas draws more sub-panels than it can fit; a panel that does not fit is
  reachable, not clipped.
- Every interactive mark is tappable at 24 × 24 CSS px.
- Desktop is byte-identical unless a defect is being fixed there too.
- The audit harness passes, and each change was checked against its own
  rendered screenshot.

Preserve the ViewTube visual design. Do not redesign module chrome, controllers
or headers while implementing this.

---

## 8. What phases 1-3 changed against this plan

Three things the plan did not anticipate, all found by running the harness:

**`markInteraction` was added to the contract.** The touch floor as originally
written failed every dense-field visual, including ones where per-mark tapping
is an enhancement rather than the primary read. Enforcing it literally would
have forced a 4-row publish clock and destroyed the weekly pattern the visual
exists to show. Modules now declare `discrete` (each mark is its own target —
the floor applies) or `field` (read by colour or position, with hover/focus and
the active-context readout carrying the value). `field` is an explicit recorded
decision; omitting it means the floor applies.

**Clock Burst's donut wedges are `field`, and its legend rows became buttons.**
A 5% wedge cannot reach 24px in a phone-sized donut at any density, so the
legend row beside it — full width, always tappable — is now the accessible
picker for the same source.

**Two contract fields could contradict each other.** Engagement Pulse opened at
`defaultSelection: 10` but was clamped by `densityProfile: 6`, so the control
read "10" while the plot drew 6. The count control now governs outright,
`densityProfile` is a cap that must never sit below `defaultSelection`, and a
test enforces that. The same check exposed Heat Matrix registering columns in
`densityProfile` and rows in `defaultSelection` — two different units in fields
meant to be comparable. Heat Matrix now registers rows only; its column count
is an outcome of tile scale and the tile floor, and the renderer keeps its own
minimum-visible-columns constant.

**The landscape chrome reservation was wrong, and it hid everything else.**
`--visual-mobile-chrome-height` shipped as a flat 88px guess. Real chrome runs
165-197px, so the canvas was bounded against space the module did not have and
the module ran off a 375px-tall landscape screen: 476px of module on a 375px
viewport. It is now measured per module and published on the module root, and a
landscape module fits its screen. This also forced two density decisions that
only became visible once the canvas was honestly sized: the publish clock folds
to 12 hour bands in landscape as well as portrait, and Clock Burst drops to one
radial panel on BOTH phone compositions, because a two-panel split leaves each
legend rail too narrow to carry a source name.

**The audit harness was capturing frames that did not match their captions.**
Screenshotting seven stacked visuals from one page produced element captures
taken against bounding boxes computed before Playwright scrolled — and the hero
intro that fires on scroll resized the module underneath. One frame showed
Traffic Source Evolution's chart under the Engagement Pulse caption while the
numbers beside it were correct. Each visual is now captured on its own page
load (`?only=<id>`): nothing above it to shift, nothing to scroll. Anything
below the fold also went unpainted, which is why that defect looked like blank
space rather than a wrong frame.

**`scripts/build-data-visual-contact-sheets.mjs`** lays each viewport's visuals
out on one sheet with their measured canvas box and any failure printed
underneath, because 35 separate PNGs are not reviewable in practice — and every
defect in this section was found by eye, after the numbers had already passed.

**The landscape canvas no longer holds a fixed ratio.** A landscape phone is
wide and short: holding 16:9 there made height the binding constraint and left
a third of the module width unused on either side of the evidence. Landscape
now defaults to `landscapeAspect: "fill"` — full module width, whatever height
is left under the chrome, ratio falling out of that — with a 4:1 ceiling that
only guards against a pathologically wide screen. Portrait and desktop still
hold `canvasAspect`. Landscape canvases went from 316-420px wide to the full
812px at 844x390, and the publish clock carries all 24 hour columns there again
rather than folding to 12.

**Open for review:** Heat Matrix portrait now draws ~16 columns of 18px tiles
rather than the 7-9 columns of larger tiles in section 3.3. Tile edge follows
the mark scale (36 -> 18, the same halving applied everywhere), and how many
columns that yields follows from it. It reads well, but it is denser than the
original target — say so and the column minimum can be lowered instead.
