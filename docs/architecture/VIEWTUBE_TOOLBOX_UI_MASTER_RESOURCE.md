## 1. Governing laws

1. **Hierarchy = geometry.** Structural depth controls height, stroke, radius, shadow, typography and spacing.
2. **Level owns geometry.** Component anatomy never invents structural dimensions.
3. **Component = anatomy.** Buttons, dropdowns, switches, radios, uploads and cards define internal composition and state behavior only.
4. **Color = identity.** Family color is inherited; feature children do not invent arbitrary colors.
5. **Fill = state.** Accent = identity/primary/selected; white = secondary/inactive; light tint = passive/informational; black = structural.
6. **4px rhythm.** Structural spacing derives from 4px.
7. **Disconnected != missing UI.** Authentication gates capability/data, not the existence of the interface.
8. **Reference Library = certification surface.** Production primitives must be demonstrated there using the same exports/tokens.
9. **No parallel authority.** Page-local CSS, prototypes and compatibility components cannot silently create a second geometry system.
10. **Business behavior is preserved during visual migration.** Presentation migration and data/feature removal ship separately.

11. **Dashboard promotion preserves ownership.** A Dashboard widget may hand off to a Toolbox workstation when the job becomes multi-stage, but the two surfaces must consume the same canonical domain state rather than synchronize duplicate local stores.
12. **Promotion is composition, not embedding.** Do not solve promotion by mounting a full `WidgetShell` inside a Toolbox or mounting a full Studio Toolbox inside a Dashboard widget. Share capability/state contracts below the top-level surface.

## 1.5. Toolbox promotion composition contract

The product-level decision for when a Dashboard widget should remain compact versus hand off to a deeper workstation is defined in `docs/specifications/TOOLBOX_PROMOTION_AND_WORKFLOW_CHAINS.md`.

For Toolbox implementation:

- the compact widget carries selected Project/video/asset/package context through the universal handoff contract;
- the Toolbox opens directly to the relevant internal page/mode when safe and available;
- closing/returning preserves canonical selection and does not fork state;
- promoted tools continue to use this document's Toolbox/SubToolbox hierarchy, controls, focus states, responsive laws and certification requirements;
- a promoted tool may expose additional pages and deeper operations, but should not grow a second private capability model;
- Dashboard-specific shell geometry remains owned by the Widget system.

## 2. Canonical hierarchy

| Semantic level | Legacy label | Primary use | Height | Stroke | Radius | Shadow | Default type |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T0 | Toolbox shell | Top-level tool/module | 80px | 5px | 16px | 10px | 26px / 1000 |
| T1 | L0 / Subtoolbox | Direct Toolbox child / peer action | 56px | 4px | 12px | 6px | 20px / 1000 |
| Former compact shell | Historical compatibility label only | No second shell geometry | - | - | - | - | SUPERSEDED |
| T2 | L1 child | Standard interior peer | 48px | 3px | 8px | 4px | 18px / 1000 |
| T3 | L2 dense child | Dense/compact peer | 32px | 2px | 6px | 2px | 12px / 1000 |

The former separate Compact Subtoolbox shell geometry is **SUPERSEDED**. Existing `heightMode="compact"` callers are compatibility-only and must not receive alternate shell height/stroke/radius/shadow geometry. Compactness may describe content density only.

### Executable desktop/mobile shell matrix

| Surface | Desktop | Mobile | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Main Toolbox shell | 80px / 5px / 16px / 10px / 26px title | 56px height / 14px radius / 6px shadow | Mobile keeps the 26px title and permits two tight wrapped lines. |
| SubToolbox shell | 56px / 4px / 12px / 6px / 20px title | 44px height / 10px radius / 4px shadow | Mobile keeps the 20px title and permits two tight wrapped lines. |
| L1 interior structural level | 48px / 3px / 8px / 4px / 18px title | responsive composition, not a new shell | Structural level, not a Compact Subtoolbox shell. |
| L2 dense structural level | 32px / 2px / 6px / 2px / 12px title | responsive composition | Dense structural level. |

`TOOLBOX_MOBILE_HEADER_DNA` is an intentional mobile shell override, not evidence that desktop 56/44 geometry returned.

### Structural level vs component/control size

Do not conflate the shell/structural ladder with component-size variants.

| Component level | Height | Stroke | Radius | Shadow | Font |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| L0 action | 56px | 4px | 12px | 6px | 24px |
| L1 standard | 48px | 3px | 8px | 5px | 18px |
| L2 compact/dense | 32px | 2px | 6px | 4px | 12px |

Separate control-size aliases may expose micro 26px / compact 32px / standard 48px / action 56px. A size variant changes component anatomy/density; it does not create another Toolbox/SubToolbox structural shell.

### Paired-height equations

- T1: `26 + 4 + 26 = 56px`
- T2: `22 + 4 + 22 = 48px`
- T3: `14 + 4 + 14 = 32px`
- Split-left rail width = full row height.
- A smaller control at a level does **not** silently thin the level stroke.

## 3. Token architecture

Current implementation authority remains `src/components/subtoolbox/tokens.ts`: Main Toolbox `80 / 5 / 16 / 10 / 26`, SubToolbox/L0 `56 / 4 / 12 / 6 / 20`, L1 `48 / 3 / 8 / 4 / 18`, and L2 `32 / 2 / 6 / 2 / 12`. The former `compactShell` token authority remains removed; compactness describes density, not a second shell geometry.

## 4. Color system

Production palette authority is `src/styles/toolboxPalette.ts` -> `VT_SPECTRUM_PALETTE_06`:

`#FA618A`, `#FF7F6B`, `#FFA85C`, `#FFDA47`, `#C0F240`, `#3FEE56`, `#4EE4BE`, `#36E0F6`, `#528FFA`, `#A467F4`, `#F55EFC`, `#FF7AC8`.

Canonical color inheritance is **12-color palette -> SubToolbox title/icon pair -> nested component pair**. `getToolboxPaletteColors(index)` owns the pairing rule: the SubToolbox title/header uses `getPaletteColor(index)`; the icon section uses `getPaletteColor(index + 4)`, wrapping through the same 12-color palette. `SubToolbox` exposes those two resolved colors to every nested primitive as `--pair-a` (title/header) and `--pair-b` (icon section). Components must consume that inherited pair and must not select, rotate, or synthesize their own palette pair. Component-specific props may change anatomy/state, but not silently replace the owning SubToolbox pair.

Production nested components must not expose arbitrary palette escape hatches such as `railColor`, `labelColor`, `accentColor`, `surfaceColor`, `controlColor`, `toneColor`, or equivalent props merely to recolor normal component anatomy. If a region genuinely needs a different normal palette pair, give it its own child `SubToolbox` and `paletteIndex`. Semantic colors remain valid when they encode meaning rather than decoration—for example error/warning/success state, rank/status, or a data-visual encoding.

A component rendered through a React portal must explicitly bridge the resolved `--pair-a` / `--pair-b` values onto the detached portal root because CSS inheritance stops when that DOM subtree moves under `document.body`. Open menus, popovers, and future detached surfaces must therefore retain the exact title/icon pair of their owning SubToolbox.

Older standalone/documented palette sequences are historical references only unless production tokens are deliberately changed.

## 5. Primitive families

Standard button; split-left button; Head/Tail split-left action; Analytics-style split-left dropdown; input/search/number input; textarea; select/dropdown/multiselect; checkbox; radio; switch; toggle; segmented control; slider; badge/tag; progress; metric/stat cell; output/information card; scroll/results surface; table/data surface; state panel; Tight Reveal upload; Guide Subtoolbox; inspector/panel recipe.

Controls should be **loose by default**. Checkbox, radio, switch, toggle and peer controls do not require an enclosing card merely to exist.

## 6. Split-left contract

- rail width = row height
- rail divider = outer level stroke
- only the left rail is split in the Analytics-style dropdown
- small label such as `SET` sits above the arrow
- right region is one uninterrupted value/title area
- no separate right-side chevron compartment
- open menu preserves closed geometry, family color and shadow
- open menus use the approved small separation gap and must not be clipped

PR #207 merged this requested anatomy and token-derived radius/shadow/gap behavior. PR #211 added static-render regression assertions. Desktop/mobile visual open-state certification remains separate.

## 7. Fields and text areas

T2 standard field remains 48px / 3px / 8px / 4px / ~14px. Focus preserves structural identity and uses inherited accent. Textareas use bounded registered heights and internal scrolling. Broad global input/widget/Toolbox selectors must not leak across ownership boundaries.

## 8. Tight Reveal upload

Tight Reveal #05 is the canonical upload anatomy. It replaces legacy dashed drop zones and has no legacy black outer frame.

## 9. Guide Subtoolbox

Guide Subtoolbox remains an instruction-first T1 module with Info, Instructions and Process / AI Cost variants. Productionization/certification remains incomplete.

## 10. State contract

`idle`, `hover`, `focus-visible`, `active`, `selected/on`, `disabled`, `loading`, `ready`, `empty`, `filtered-zero`, `blocked`, `disconnected`, `connecting`, `reconnect-required`, `stale`, `error`, `success`.

Shells remain present for loading/empty/error/disconnected. Connection state and data state are independent. DISCONNECTED != EMPTY; DISCONNECTED != ERROR; DISCONNECTED != MISSING UI.

## 11. Motion authority

Current executable tokens on the audited main define:

- shell/SubToolbox collapse: **600ms ease-out** via `SUBTOOLBOX_COLLAPSE_TRANSITION`;
- control/micro interaction token: **180ms**;
- reduced-motion: transitions disabled/reduced through the production motion classes.

A historical 300ms shell rule is superseded. Feature-specific data/widget animation timing does not redefine Toolbox disclosure timing.


**MOTION AUTHORITY — RECONCILED 2026-09-22.** Toolbox/Subtoolbox/module/disclosure open-close motion is 600ms ease-out. Micro-interactions such as hover, focus, toggle feedback and icon state changes remain faster at 150–300ms. Reduced-motion mode is required.

## 12. Responsive contract

Phone top-level Toolbox/Widget modules are full width by default. Structural grids collapse semantically. Registered-height controls do not grow because children wrap. Headers never scroll. Long content uses bounded internal scrolling. T0/T1 shell geometry changes only through the canonical mobile DNA and must be explicit and certified.

### Mobile header allocation law

1. The icon rail, complete title, help target and collapse target are protected structural content.
2. Main Toolbox titles retain the established 26px size and may wrap to two complete lines; SubToolbox titles retain the established 20px size.
3. Optional header extras consume only remaining width. If that width is insufficient, the extras move to the canonical secondary action strip before any protected title/control is compressed.
4. Page-local fixed-width header action clusters are forbidden.
5. Mobile help/collapse interactive targets are at least 44px even when the visual glyph is smaller.
6. `toolbox-system.css` owns structural responsive header allocation. `subtoolbox-system.css` owns control anatomy inside that geometry. `perf.css` may optimize rendering but must not resize, clamp or ellipsize canonical Toolbox headers.

### Mobile vertical sizing law

SubToolboxes are intrinsic-height by default on phone layouts. `openUnits` may provide desktop/tablet minimum-height guidance, but its generated minimum is disabled on stacked mobile modules. Equal-height behavior belongs to the parent layout and must never be recreated with page-local `h-full` on ordinary phone stacks. Upload/media targets publish a preferred height through the primitive and are responsively capped on phones.

## 13. Accessibility contract

Canonical interactive primitives require keyboard navigation, logical tab order, visible focus, appropriate native/ARIA semantics, intentional disabled vs aria-disabled behavior, icon-action labels, non-color-only selected state, sufficient contrast, reduced motion and usable mobile touch targets.

## 14. Grid/layout authority

Use canonical layout recipes before page-local grid templates. Preferred spacing: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24px. Avoid double padding. Collapse columns rather than shrinking controls below their structural level.

## 15. Implementation authority / repo map

| Area | Authority |
| --- | --- |
| `src/components/Toolbox.tsx` | canonical Toolbox/Subtoolbox structural behavior |
| `src/styles/toolbox-system.css` | Toolbox shell visual system |
| `src/styles/subtoolbox-system.css` | Subtoolbox/container states |
| `src/components/subtoolbox/tokens.ts` | geometry/type/spacing/motion authority |
| `src/components/subtoolbox/SubToolboxPrimitives.tsx` | reusable controls/surfaces/states |
| `src/components/subtoolbox/SubToolboxSplitPrimitives.tsx` | split-left button/dropdown and KPI anatomy |
| `src/styles/subtoolbox-split-primitives.css` | split-left/KPI visual implementation |
| `src/components/subtoolbox/SubToolboxLayouts.tsx` | reusable composition recipes |
| `src/components/subtoolbox/registry.ts` | recipe/migration mapping |
| `src/components/ToolboxUIReferenceLibrary.tsx` | visual certification surface |
| `src/styles/toolboxPalette.ts` | production palette authority |
| `docs/architecture/VIEWTUBE_TOOLBOX_UI_MASTER_RESOURCE.md` | governance/rules/audits/status authority |

Legacy/quarantine files are reference-only and must not become a second authority.

## 16. Coded primitives <-> Reference Library certification

Required chain: `TOKENS -> CODED PRIMITIVE -> UI REFERENCE LIBRARY EXAMPLE -> PRODUCTION CONSUMER`.

Use status vocabulary: `CANONICAL`, `IMPLEMENTED`, `VERIFIED`, `MIGRATE`, `LEGACY COMPATIBILITY`, `EXCEPTION`, `PLANNED`, `SUPERSEDED`, `REMOVE`, `REGRESSION / OPEN ISSUE`.

## 17. Certification ledger

| Primitive/family | Code | Reference Library | Tests | Current status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Toolbox/Subtoolbox shells | yes | yes | visual required | 80/56 authority implemented on `fix/toolbox-geometry-authority-2026-09-22`; visual certification required before VERIFIED |
| Standard buttons | yes | yes | required | IMPLEMENTED |
| Split-left actions | yes | yes | partial | IMPLEMENTED |
| Analytics split-left dropdown | yes | yes | static render + controlled interaction/portal test | IMPLEMENTED / TEST-CERTIFIED; visual certification open |
| Inputs/Textareas | yes | yes | required | IMPLEMENTED |
| Checkbox/Radio/Switch/Toggle | yes/partial | expanding | required | IMPLEMENTED / MIGRATE |
| Tags/Badges | yes | yes | required | IMPLEMENTED |
| Tight Reveal upload | yes | yes | required | IMPLEMENTED |
| Guide Subtoolbox | not fully canonical | designed | required | PLANNED / MIGRATE |
| Projects T0 tool composition | yes | update required | required | IMPLEMENTED / REFERENCE UPDATE REQUIRED |

## 18. Current audit findings

**2026-09-27 cross-application follow-up:** PR #470 merged the breakpoint-scoped equal-height contract for `MediaAnalyzer` and `StoryboardStudio`, so phone stacks remain intrinsic without depending on override specificity. PR #474 then migrated the live `/seo-generator` route from its duplicate VIDEO PUBLISHER-style header/action implementation and legacy `Standard*` controls to the canonical primitive system while preserving SEO generation/export/sync behavior. SEO Generator and Video Publisher remain intentionally separate production tools pending a deliberate capability-consolidation decision.


### Responsive stabilization baseline — 2026-09-26

| Dimension | Baseline | Target |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Accessibility | 2/4 | 4/4 |
| Performance | 3/4 | 4/4 |
| Responsive | 1/4 | 4/4 |
| Theming | 3/4 | 4/4 |
| Implementation integrity | 2/4 | 4/4 |
| **Total** | **11/20** | **20/20** |

Primary failure: optional feature actions and competing CSS owners could consume or override protected mobile Toolbox geometry. PR #468 is the first stabilization wave. Do not mark this baseline superseded until 375px, 390px, 430px portrait, phone landscape, tablet/narrow desktop and desktop screenshots are visually certified.


**Resolved/advanced:** Analytics split-left anatomy is in production code with static-render coverage; separate compact shell token authority is removed; current shell hierarchy is T0 80px/26px title, T1 56px/20px title, T2 48px/18px and T3 32px/12px.

**Remaining:** visual desktop/mobile certification of the 80/56 hierarchy; historical `heightMode="compact"` callers/labels cleanup; CSS ownership leaks; bounded-height/mobile regressions; duplicate embedded shells; Projects feature-local shell debt; motion authority reconciliation by system.

## 19. Page-specific notes

### Studio Hub
Primary certification/migration target. Reference Library must show canonical primitives, levels and states.

### Analytics / Master Data Tables
PR #207 productionized the left-rail label/arrow + uninterrupted value region; PR #211 locks trigger semantics/anatomy. Feature-local table/toolbar CSS must not become Toolbox authority.

### Video Manager
Disconnected state must preserve the full UI. Connection gates data/actions, not the normal tool interface.

### Comment Responder
Persistent shell + explicit disconnected/data states. Do not conflate no comments with no connection.

### Video Publisher
Normalize geometry only while preserving publishing behavior.

### SEO Generator
Canonical Toolbox/Studio primitive migration completed in PR #474. Preserve SEO generation, Brain writeback, Sheets export, Drive sync and ZIP behavior. Do not reintroduce native page-local buttons/inputs, legacy `Standard*` controls, hard-coded Toolbox shell colors or the duplicate VIDEO PUBLISHER identity. Any future SEO Generator ↔ Video Publisher consolidation is a feature-architecture decision, not a visual-system cleanup.

### Thumbnail Studio
Primary acceptance-test candidate for nested modules, inputs, actions, uploads and collapsed sections.

### Projects
Project Board, Publishing Schedule, Project Studio and Storyboard Studio remain independent T0 Toolboxes. The PR #164 page-level switcher composition is SUPERSEDED. Duplicate inner shell geometry remains MIGRATE / OPEN ISSUE. Preserve Kanban/calendar behavior while removing duplicate chrome. Projects Reference Library certification remains required.

### Creator Vault / Asset Engine
Use canonical shells, upload, tags and bounded grids.

### Editor
Editor timeline controls are a separate system. Reuse tokens selectively; do not force Toolbox hierarchy onto timeline-specific controls.

## 24. Document editing protocol

This file is authority, not a scratchpad. Stable rules belong in numbered sections; page exceptions stay local; every production rule change gets a dated decision entry; every system-level conversation adds one concise Living update log row; prototype-only work remains non-production; retain superseded history; inspect code when docs disagree; update code/registry/Reference Library/tests/master together for new primitives; search consumers before deletion.

## 25. Definition of done

A Toolbox UI migration is complete only when hierarchy, geometry, color inheritance, state behavior, accessibility, motion, mobile composition and business functionality are verified; the Reference Library uses the same canonical primitive; regression checks pass; no competing geometry authority is introduced; and this document's ledger/log/page notes are updated.

## 27. Conversation handoff / master-resource update protocol

### 27.1 Audit
Review relevant code edits, commits, branches, PRs, merge state, screenshots, regressions, fixes, primitive/token/CSS/layout/mobile changes, states, API/connection UI behavior, accessibility, Reference Library work, tests, legacy code and lessons. Ignore unrelated ViewTube work unless it materially affects this system.

### 27.2 Classify
Use: CANONICAL, IMPLEMENTED, VERIFIED, MIGRATE, LEGACY COMPATIBILITY, EXCEPTION, PLANNED, SUPERSEDED, REMOVE, REGRESSION / OPEN ISSUE. Never promote a prototype, screenshot, temporary patch or feature-local rule to CANONICAL without explicit system acceptance.

### 27.3 Evidence
Record repository, branch, PR, commit, merged-to-main YES/NO/UNKNOWN, files, components, primitives, selectors, tokens, recipes, tests, previous/new behavior, affected pages, desktop/mobile/open/closed/connection/data-state verification and regression risk when available.

### 27.4 Authority checks
T0=80/5/16/10/26. T1=56/4/12/6/20. Former Compact shell=SUPERSEDED. T2=48/3/8/4/18. T3=32/2/6/2/12. Level owns geometry; component owns anatomy. Base rhythm 4px. Paired heights T1 26+4+26=56, T2 22+4+22=48, T3 14+4+14=32. Split rail width=row height. Preserve canonical shell geometry on mobile; collapse layout before shrinking registered controls.

### 27.5 Code <-> Reference Library
`TOKENS -> CODED PRIMITIVE -> UI REFERENCE LIBRARY EXAMPLE -> PRODUCTION CONSUMER`.

Code changed without library -> REFERENCE LIBRARY UPDATE REQUIRED. Library outruns production -> REFERENCE ONLY / NOT YET PRODUCTIONIZED. Code/library/states/variants/tests align -> CERTIFIED.

### 27.6 Registry / decisions / page status
For changed components record canonical name, family, levels, source, Reference Library section, states, palette/mobile/accessibility behavior, consumers, status, replacement, last verification and notes. Add dated decisions. Update affected pages with CURRENT STATE, WHAT CHANGED, WHAT REMAINS, NEXT SAFE MIGRATION, KNOWN REGRESSIONS and CERTIFICATION STATUS.

### 27.7 Motion
Verify Toolbox, Subtoolbox, module and disclosure shells at the 600ms open-close authority while keeping micro-interactions in the 150–300ms range. Dropdown-specific menu motion may remain faster where it is a micro-interaction rather than a shell disclosure. Reduced-motion behavior must remain intact.

### 27.8 Required output
A. IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOUND  
B. MASTER DOCUMENT CHANGES  
C. CODE <-> DOCUMENT ALIGNMENT  
D. UI LIBRARY ALIGNMENT  
E. UNFINISHED WORK  
F. REPOSITORY STATUS  
G. HANDOFF BLOCK

### 27.9 Preservation / GitHub rules
Inspect current main before claims/writes; do not overwrite newer work; preserve history and mark superseded rules; do not confuse PR state with main, prototypes with production or docs with migration completion; do not duplicate canonical primitives; do not silently reconcile conflicting motion/geometry; preserve working behavior; keep Widget/Editor CSS separate from Toolbox CSS; edit the living DOCX rather than replacing it with a smaller file; commit DOCX only through a binary-safe verified path.

## 24. 2026-09-25 mobile correction wave

This wave comes directly from Render/iPhone visual review and overrides any earlier wording that treated the current mobile Toolbox system as visually certified.

### 24.1 Keep the useful PR #432 fixes; restore the correct collapse symbol
Keep the isolated header action/help/collapse layout, 16px minimum mobile editable text, VisualViewport keyboard handling, and the structural-gutter versus paint-safe-edge-clearance distinction. Revert only the chevron substitution: Toolbox and SubToolbox headers must use the established animated four-direction arrow expand/collapse symbol, with the repaired independent hitbox and 600ms shell motion. Do not add a second down-arrow button.

### 24.2 Painted interior clearance
Top spacing is certified by visible painted clearance, not raw padding numbers. The first control under a Toolbox, SubToolbox, or MiniSubToolbox header must have visually equal top/side/bottom clearance after accounting for child strokes, hard shadows and focus outlines. The Video Manager Thumbnail MiniSubToolbox is the primary acceptance case; Upload/Generate must not crowd the top or right header edges.

### 24.3 P1 custom-dropdown state regression
Observed behavior: choosing a new custom-dropdown option closes the menu but leaves the old visible value. Treat custom Toolbox dropdown families as unverified until interaction-tested. Every controlled dropdown must derive its trigger from the current controlled value, dispatch the selection exactly once, reflect the parent state immediately, and close after dispatch. The split-left dropdown now has a controlled interaction/portal test; audit `SubToolboxDropdownControl`, `SubToolboxTopTitleDropdown`, StudioDropdown, video selectors and any legacy custom select still in production. Add interaction tests, not only static source tests.

### 24.4 Vault asset-module donor-parity system
`VaultAssetModule` is the current production compound for Creator Vault assets. Its fixed 276×189 donor geometry, 30px header, explicit landscape/portrait layouts, half-height audio/document variants, editable title, inline spectrum tag editor, selection placement and dirty-save notes are governed by `VAULT_ASSET_MODULE_DNA` and `docs/ui/VAULT_ASSET_MODULE_REFERENCE_PARITY.md`. Creator Vault and the Studio Hub primitive track must render the same component/CSS. `SubToolboxVaultAsset` remains only as a compatibility primitive while consumers migrate; do not use it as the visual authority for new Vault work.

### 24.5 Spectrum Tag L3 + Tag Editor #30 compound
Add a denser L3 Spectrum Tag for asset-card metadata. It remains on the 12-color spectrum and combines with Tag Editor #30 behavior: add new tags, integrated X removal, immediate asset update, and no Vault-local duplicate styling. The Component Library must show L0/L1/L2/L3 plus the removable/editable compound.

### 24.6 New SubToolbox-level split-left action
Create a canonical full-row split-left action whose collapsed appearance matches a collapsed SubToolbox: square icon rail, exact level stroke/radius/shadow, centered icon, inherited palette pair and full-row button semantics. Migrate the Video Manager "CONNECT YOUR YOUTUBE CHANNEL TO LOAD VIDEOS" action to this component and add it to the Component Library.

### 24.7 New Thumbnail MiniSubToolbox compound
Promote the Thumbnail header + Upload/Generate + preview composition into a reusable compound. Header actions must remain paint-safe and collision-free; media preview uses aspect-aware contain/fitted behavior; narrow layouts compact intentionally rather than overflow. Add the compound to the Component Library.

### 24.8 Sequential 12-color allocation law
The palette is an ordered allocation system, not just a color source. Top-level Toolboxes advance through the 12 colors in order. Inside each Toolbox, the first SubToolbox uses the next sequential palette pair, and siblings/nested children continue the sequence instead of restarting or choosing feature-local decorative colors. Prefer a centralized allocator over scattered numeric `paletteIndex` literals. Add wraparound and sample-tree tests.

### 24.9 Component Library additions required by this wave
Add and certify: restored four-arrow collapse control; interactive dropdown selection proof; SubToolbox-level split-left action; Thumbnail MiniSubToolbox; Spectrum Tag L3; L3 + Tag Editor #30 compound; Vault editable title; large Vault selection checkbox; Vault notes field; Vault tag editor; landscape/portrait/intermediate-ratio media states; and a deterministic palette-sequence specimen.

### 24.10 Implementation order before final documentation/skill certification
1. restore four-arrow collapse control while preserving PR #432 header isolation;
2. fix painted top/interior clearance for Toolbox, SubToolbox and MiniSubToolbox;
3. fix controlled custom-dropdown behavior and add interaction tests;
4. formalize palette allocation and migrate Studio Hub/Vault/Video Manager ordering;
5. build the SubToolbox split-left action and migrate the YouTube-connect row;
6. build the Thumbnail MiniSubToolbox compound and migrate Video Manager;
7. redesign Vault asset cards for editable/adaptive production behavior;
8. add L3 Spectrum Tags + Tag Editor #30;
9. add all changed/new states to the Component Library;
10. certify portrait/landscape mobile plus desktop/narrow layouts before marking this wave VERIFIED.
