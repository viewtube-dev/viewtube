## Product rule

ViewTube is one creator workstation with many specialized surfaces. Deep modules keep narrow canonical ownership; pages, widgets and tools consume capabilities rather than becoming independent products or truth stores.

## Creator lifecycle

Discover → Validate → Design → Produce → Assemble → Package → Publish → Engage → Learn → Operate.

## Master Tools

1. Opportunity Radar
2. Channel Intelligence Hub
3. Content Strategy Lab
4. Project & Production Command
5. Script & Story Studio
6. Visual Development Studio
7. Vault & Asset Engine
8. Video Director & Editor
9. Packaging & Experiment Lab
10. Publisher & Distribution Center
11. Audience & Community Desk
12. Monetization & Operations Hub

Master Tools are product groupings, not backend owners. Widgets are views into capabilities, not separate products.

### Dashboard instrument → Toolbox workstation boundary

Dashboard and Toolbox are different presentation scales over the same canonical capabilities.

- **Dashboard instruments** should optimize for glanceability, status, compact evidence, bounded controls, one or a few high-value actions, and resumable handoff.
- **Toolbox workstations** should own deep multi-stage creator work such as editing, generation queues, variant comparison, provenance/lineage, approvals, history, and repeated cross-tool handoffs.
- A complex capability may have both: the Dashboard keeps a compact instrument while the Toolbox exposes the full workflow.
- Promotion never creates another backend owner or private synchronized copy of Project, ContentBuild, Asset, Package, Evidence, Operation or Outcome state.
- Cross-tool workflows preserve canonical identity through `ViewTubeActionPacket` and the Creator Operations convergence path rather than URL-only navigation or copied UI state.

The detailed promotion criteria, twenty current candidates, workflow-envelope contract and forty reusable creator workflow recipes live in `docs/specifications/TOOLBOX_PROMOTION_AND_WORKFLOW_CHAINS.md`. These recipes are orchestration prior art, not forty automatic capabilities or task identities.

The compact-widget versus full-workstation boundary and reusable cross-tool workflow recipes are specified in `docs/specifications/TOOLBOX_PROMOTION_AND_WORKFLOW_CHAINS.md`. That specification is subordinate to this architecture: a promoted Toolbox remains a surface over existing capabilities, and a workflow recipe remains orchestration over existing owners rather than a new domain or persistence system.

## Six canonical convergence systems

### 1. Creator Context & Knowledge
Resolves creator/channel facts, validated knowledge, style, goals, active Project/ContentBuild, current surface/selection and personalization permissions. Context may reference evidence but does not own evidence.

### 2. Evidence & Intelligence
Separates measured evidence, deterministic derived signals, and specialist interpretation. analytics-canon remains analytics truth. Statistics, Audience, Channel, Opportunity, Algorithm and other specialists remain modules rather than competing truth stores.

### 3. Project / Content / Asset Graph
Project owns workflow planning. ContentBuild owns durable evolving content identity. Asset Engine owns artifact lifecycle/lineage/version/variant semantics. Vault is the browse/search/manage/storage experience over the same asset identities. Video, Publishing, Launch and tool packages should increasingly be projections rather than copied state universes.

### 4. Creator Operations & Generation
Provides one operation/provenance contract for reasoning operations, generation, transforms, render jobs, research, tool handoffs and external execution. Existing ActionPacket, GenerationRecord and ToolReceipt concepts may converge through shared operation identity without forcing an unsafe immediate storage rewrite.

### 5. Outcomes, Evaluation & Learning
Unifies producer contracts and lifecycle across actions, outcomes, evaluations, learning candidates and governed promotion. One-off correlations or successes never silently become durable Channel Knowledge.

### 6. Brain Runtime & Experience
All creator-facing AI surfaces route through the shared BrainRuntime/BrainModelGateway/task-capability experience contract. UI requests capabilities; UI does not assemble bespoke provider stacks.

## Boundaries that remain distinct

- Analytics truth vs Intelligence interpretation.
- Creator Knowledge vs Evidence.
- Project vs ContentBuild.
- Asset Engine semantics vs Vault library/storage UX.
- Brain orchestration vs specialist intelligence.
- AI/recommendation vs Publishing/external side effects.
- Domain architecture vs Task/mission status.
- Product capability vs UI surface.

## Canonical ownership laws

- Unionize capabilities, not owners.
- Prefer projection over synchronization.
- Prefer shared contracts over giant files.
- External side effects keep strict owners.
- Models do not own calculations, permissions, durable knowledge, or task truth.
- Current code/tests/runtime may prove implementation; they do not redefine intended product architecture silently.
- A new capability must reconcile against existing capabilities and owners before acceptance.

## Capability model

Capabilities are durable abilities with stable CAP IDs. A capability has one canonical owner, may participate in multiple Master Tools/domains/lifecycle stages, and may have many tasks. Task turnover never changes capability identity.

Machine registry: docs/architecture/capabilities.json.

## Change protocol

Any proposed feature/system/integration/design must be classified as:
- existing capability extension;
- new accepted capability;
- implementation of an accepted capability;
- product-surface redesign;
- consolidation/simplification;
- experimental opportunity.

Before creating a new capability, reconcile current Product Architecture, Capability Registry, Domain Authority, Task Index, active mission/PR and donor artifacts.


## Strategic master sources

Before major feature/tool/system ideation, consolidation, creator-workstation redesign, AI/agent architecture expansion, API/integration planning, analytics invention, monetization architecture, or product-roadmap work, consult:

- `docs/references/DEEP_RESEARCH_CONSTRUCTION_SOURCE.md` — MASTER_SOURCE tier; broad research and construction blueprint containing the feature-canon methodology, master-tool consolidation model, API/capability atlas, Channel Brain and agent architecture, analytics/visualization framework, creator-workflow model, infrastructure/economics/governance research program, and final master-document production blueprint.

Use it to challenge and improve the current architecture. Promote accepted improvements through this document, the Capability Registry, Domain Authorities, Decision records, Integrated Application Program, and Task Index rather than treating source proposals as automatically canonical.


## Page-surface feature opportunity registry

**Intake date:** 2026-09-27  
**Status:** EXPERIMENTAL OPPORTUNITY CATALOG — immediately eligible for reconciliation, planning and task promotion; not an implementation claim.  
**Purpose:** preserve high-value page/tool ideas in the canonical product architecture so future development can discover, compare, consolidate and promote them without creating parallel systems.

### Promotion rule

Every item below is a **surface proposal**, not automatically a new backend capability. Before implementation:

1. reconcile it against \`docs/architecture/capabilities.json\`;
2. attach it to the owning Domain Authority and existing task/mission where one exists;
3. reuse canonical Project/ContentBuild, Asset Engine/Vault, analytics-canon, BrainRuntime, outcome/evaluation, widget, publishing and UI contracts instead of creating duplicate owners;
4. classify the work as capability extension, accepted new capability, implementation, surface redesign, consolidation, or experiment;
5. create exact implementation tasks in Task Authority only after the owning systems and acceptance boundary are known;
6. update the User Guide projection when creator-facing behavior ships;
7. verify data → logic → UI → outcome, plus mobile/accessibility where applicable.

### Consolidation architecture for the 80 ideas

The catalog intentionally resolves to a smaller shared foundation:

1. **Intelligence layer** — BrainRuntime + Creator Context/Knowledge + Evidence & Intelligence + specialist modules + Outcomes/Evaluation/Learning.
2. **ContentBuild layer** — Idea/brief → research → script → assets → production → edit → package → publish → performance → learning around Project/ContentBuild identity.
3. **Asset layer** — Asset Engine + Vault + generation/render provenance + lineage + project/publication relationships.
4. **Measurement layer** — VT-SYNC + analytics-canon + cohorts/experiments/anomalies/outcomes/evidence.
5. **Orchestration layer** — Projects + tasks + operations + workflows + approvals + integrations + notifications.

A page may expose several of these layers, but should not recreate their persistence, lifecycle or truth ownership.

### Immediate development-use rule

Future ideation, audits and implementation plans for Dashboard, Studio, Projects, Analytics, Editor, Vault, Settings or User Guide must check this registry first. When an idea is selected for development, keep its \`IDEA-*\` ID in the scoped plan/task/PR until it is either:

- promoted into an accepted capability/implementation;
- merged into another idea/capability;
- deferred with reason;
- retired as redundant;
- shipped and documented.

This keeps the ideas active in future development without falsely representing them as completed product behavior.
