# ViewTube Projects / Asset Engine / ContentBuild / Video Package — Living Workflow & System Reference

**Status:** Living architecture + implementation authority  
**Created:** 2026-09-22  
**Last audited main:** `c7d9f55268af61569fdba9c2afab256a5cfbf6ff` (2026-09-24 docs consolidation Wave 2)  
**Canonical owner / concern:** Cross-system Project → ContentBuild → Video Package workflow, creator-facing Project continuity, and ownership boundaries.  
**Related canonical authority:** `docs/architecture/VIEWTUBE_ASSET_ENGINE_MASTER_RESOURCE.md` owns detailed Asset Engine asset/version/variant/generation/publishing contracts.  
**Supersedes for current-state authority:** `ASSET_ENGINE_CONTENTBUILD_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_2026-09-20.md` and `PROJECT_CONTENTBUILD_ASSET_ENGINE_VIDEO_PACKAGE_CONSOLIDATION_2026-09-22.md`; those files remain historical implementation/consolidation records.  
**Primary reassembly baseline:** PR #302 / merge commit `3f9cb2dab3e2bb3247ce9bd904051ae8b0b93d2d`  
**Scope:** Projects page, Project Builder, Project Board, calendar/scheduling, channel planning, project planning, Asset Engine, ContentBuild, Video Package, Publishing Package, Vault handoffs, Studio tools, editor handoffs, YouTube binding, analytics and learning.

---

## 1. Purpose

This document is the living cross-system authority for how ViewTube turns a creator idea into a planned project, durable ContentBuild, video package, working assets, published YouTube video, measured outcome and reusable learning.

It exists to prevent the same work from being split into disconnected tools or duplicated stores.

The governing product rule is:

> **A creator Project, its ContentBuild, Video Package, Asset Engine manifestation, Vault assets, editor work, Publishing Package and eventual YouTube video are different views of one durable content identity.**

This file must be updated when any of these systems change materially.

---

## 2. Intended creator experience

The Projects page should again feel like one creator-planning system rather than six unrelated toolboxes.

### Primary tool: Project Builder

The Project Builder is the main planning and content-creation workspace.

Its main Toolbox header owns:

- **CHANNEL / PROJECT** mode toggle,
- **NEW PROJECT** action,
- active project identity/color,
- normal open/close Toolbox behavior.

### Channel side

Channel mode contains channel-level planning that must not belong to one project:

- Channel To-Do List
- Channel Goals
- AI Brain generated channel actions/goals
- compact schedule/context when useful

### Project side

Project mode operates on one selected project / ContentBuild and contains:

- Project Build Command / readiness
- Project Identity
- Project Brief
- Video Package working fields
- Thumbnail / Packaging
- Project To-Do List
- Project Goals
- schedule context
- simplified Asset Engine
- compact Publishing Package summary
- contextual handoffs to specialist tools

### Supporting top-level project tools

The intended Projects page hierarchy is:

1. **Project Builder**
2. **Project Board** with **BOARD / CALENDAR**
3. **Storyboard Studio** while it remains useful as an embedded specialist tool

Separate top-level Channel Planning, Content Asset Engine, Publishing Schedule and legacy Project Studio should not compete for ownership once their useful functions are reassembled under Builder / Board.

---

## 3. Historical product behavior to preserve

The preserved original Project Planning / Project Studio source proves the earlier integrated model included:

- header-level CHANNEL / PROJECTS switching,
- START NEW PROJECT,
- project name,
- publish date,
- project color,
- approximately 15-week content calendar,
- channel-wide tasks,
- channel-wide goals,
- project-specific tasks,
- project title,
- tags,
- description,
- script,
- thumbnail area,
- project status,
- AI strategy/generation,
- storyboard generation.

The older Projects implementation also created projects with a project type, thumbnail/media fields and project task data.

The repo user guide historically described the Projects workflow as:

- switch between Channel and Projects,
- create a project with a name, target date and color,
- see projects on their assigned calendar date,
- maintain channel to-dos/goals independently from project data.

These behaviors are parity references, not an instruction to restore obsolete CSS or duplicate legacy stores.

---

## 4. Current main state

PR #302 is now merged into current `main`. The Projects page has already been reassembled around three top-level tools:

1. **Project Builder**
2. **Project Board** with **BOARD / CALENDAR**
3. **Storyboard Studio**

Channel Planning, full Content Asset Engine, Publishing Schedule and the restored Project Studio now survive as capabilities embedded behind Builder / Board rather than competing top-level owners.

The original reassembly work is now substantially beyond that baseline. On the audited main, Project creation/recovery is centralized through `ProjectContentIdentityService`; Video Package persistence requires canonical ContentBuild scope; ContentBuild revisions protect against stale package writes; VariantGroups/versions exist; and the shared Generation workflow exposes `GenerationRequest` + `ToolReceipt`. Remaining work is concentrated in publication transaction hardening, immutable approved-publish snapshots, deeper post-publish writers/evaluation, legacy-path cleanup, and visual/mobile certification.

### Current useful production pieces

- `Project` already supports `contentBuildId`.
- `BrainContext` / project state remains the current creator-facing Project record source.
- Project-specific tasks and project goals exist.
- Channel planning tasks/goals exist.
- Publishing Schedule can write dates back to Project records.
- Project Board has lanes and workspace metadata.
- Full Projects Content Asset Engine exists.
- Project -> ContentBuild bridge exists.
- ContentBuild repository, events, assets, selections, versions, variant groups and YouTube binding exist.
- Video Package contracts exist with project and ContentBuild scope.
- Video Package -> ContentBuild synchronization exists.
- Publisher / Studio systems already have ContentBuild-aware paths in several places.

---

## 5. Reassembly baseline: PR #302

PR #302, **Reassemble Projects page around Project Builder + Board**, merged to `main` on 2026-09-22.

It is now the production baseline for the Projects-page composition described below.

### PR #302 implements

#### Project Builder
- CHANNEL / PROJECT scope
- shared Projects workspace context
- shared project selection
- shared New Project dialog
- immediate ContentBuild initialization
- automatic legacy Project -> ContentBuild synchronization
- persistent project color identity
- Project Build Command
- Project Identity
- Project Brief
- Video Package project fields
- Packaging / thumbnail subtoolbox
- Project tasks
- Project goals
- AI Brain project planning suggestions
- Simple / Full Asset Engine mode

#### Project Board
- Board / Calendar switch
- shared New Project dialog
- Board cards open the project in Builder
- Calendar cards open the project in Builder
- lane movement writes semantic Project status
- lane movement syncs ContentBuild stage
- project priority hydration
- removal of competing Board project editor/drawer

#### Calendar
- Publishing Schedule becomes the Board calendar instead of another top-level tool
- scheduled cards inherit project identity color
- schedule writes to canonical Project publishDate

---

## 6. System ownership model

### Project

**Purpose:** creator-facing planning container.

Owns creator/project workflow values such as:

- project name
- active project selection
- target publish date
- tasks
- project goals
- project notes
- lightweight project metadata
- project color / visual identity
- user-visible status where compatible

A Project is not the canonical asset graph.

### ContentBuild

**Purpose:** durable identity and lifecycle spine for the piece of content.

Owns / coordinates:

- stable `contentBuildId`
- profile
- lifecycle stage
- attached asset IDs
- selected/final assets by slot
- asset relationships
- versions
- variant groups
- workflow state
- revision
- YouTube binding
- append-only event history

### Asset Engine

**Purpose:** creator-facing orchestration/facade over ContentBuild assets and lifecycle.

The Asset Engine should:

- resolve durable work,
- attach/generated assets,
- preserve lineage,
- manage variants and versions,
- select/finalize assets,
- expose readiness,
- route work into specialist tools,
- carry ContentBuild scope across handoffs,
- preserve post-publish history.

It must not become a second Project store, Vault store, analytics store or Brain store.

### Video Package

**Purpose:** structured video-specific creative, packaging, production and publishing contract.

It already carries:

- `projectId`
- `contentBuildId`
- channel scope
- working title
- format/status
- strategy artifacts/evidence
- hooks/script/storyboard/scenes
- title and thumbnail variants/selections
- description/tags/end screen/outro/pinned comment/community assets
- Vault asset IDs
- timeline/render IDs
- Publishing checks/approval/schedule
- handoffs/blockers/provenance

### Publishing Package

**Purpose:** the YouTube-facing publication configuration belonging to the same content build.

Must cover, as applicable:

- title
- thumbnail
- description
- tags
- category
- chapters/timestamps
- education questions
- captions/language
- end screens
- related video
- playlists
- cards
- visibility
- audience
- schedule/timezone
- Premiere
- pinned comment
- community/launch assets

### Vault

**Purpose:** durable artifact/media identity and storage.

Project/ContentBuild references Vault assets. The Project Builder should not replace Vault with URL-only fields.

### Specialist tools

Script Architect, Storyboard Studio, Thumbnail Studio, Video Director, Editor, Packaging tools, Publisher, Priming and Analytics are producers/consumers of scoped ContentBuild work.

They must receive and return the same:

`contentBuildId + projectId + channelId`

when those scopes exist.

---

## 7. Canonical identity chain

The target creation path is:

```text
Creator creates Project
        ↓
Project ID
        ↓
ContentBuild created / resolved
        ↓
Project.contentBuildId saved
        ↓
Video Package initialized against SAME contentBuildId
        ↓
Project workspace metadata initialized
        ↓
Builder / Board / Calendar / Studio tools resolve same scope
```

### Required invariant

Do not create a second unrelated ContentBuild for the Video Package.

When the working project owns `contentBuildId = CB-123`, its default Video Package must be initialized with that same ContentBuild identity.

---

## 7A. Consolidated hard invariants

Wave 2 documentation consolidation promotes the still-valid hard rules from the September implementation/convergence plans into this living authority.

| Invariant | Audited state |
| --- | --- |
| One Project maps to one durable ContentBuild identity | Implemented baseline |
| Normal Video Package persistence requires canonical `contentBuildId` | Implemented baseline |
| One Project cannot silently persist packages against conflicting ContentBuilds | Implemented baseline |
| Stale package writes cannot overwrite a newer ContentBuild revision | Implemented baseline |
| Version and Option/Variant are different concepts | Implemented in ContentBuild contracts/repository |
| Selected is reversible and does not imply Final | Implemented baseline |
| Finalization/approval is explicit | Implemented baseline |
| Publishing/Launch/Readiness are projections or services, not parallel truth stores | Architectural invariant |
| Exact publication inputs must be frozen before external publish | Open: ApprovedPublishSnapshot |
| Publish retry must be resumable/idempotent and must not duplicate uploads | Open target |
| Analytics remains canonical metric truth; ContentBuild stores identity/checkpoint references | Architectural invariant |
| Learning remains governed; outcomes never rewrite historical creative truth | Architectural invariant |

Strong command boundaries should mutate canonical state synchronously and emit downstream events/projections idempotently. Avoid circular choreography such as Project → ContentBuild → Package → Project loops.

## 8. Lifecycle

Canonical ContentBuild stages currently support:

```text
IDEA
RESEARCH
CONCEPT
OUTLINE
SCRIPT
STORYBOARD
MEDIA
PACKAGE
EDIT
REVIEW
SCHEDULED
PUBLISHED
LAUNCH
MONITOR
EVALUATION
LEARNING
ARCHIVED
```

Project status values should map deliberately into this lifecycle.

PR #302 improves the mapping beyond current main. That mapping should be ported and tested.

### Simplified creator-facing lifecycle

For the compact Asset Engine, show:

```text
IDEA + STRATEGY
→ RESEARCH
→ SCRIPT + STORY
→ PRODUCTION
→ PACKAGING
→ PUBLISH
→ PERFORMANCE
```

The compact view is a manifestation of the full ContentBuild lifecycle, not a second state machine.

---

## 9. Simplified Asset Engine target

The donor `ProjectAssetEngineSimple.tsx` is a strong starting point.

Its seven lifecycle cards should be retained, then expanded into a compact asset-state instrument.

### Required asset slots

At minimum:

- Idea / Brief
- Research
- Script
- Storyboard
- Media
- Title
- Thumbnail
- Publishing Package
- Final Render / Video
- YouTube binding / Performance when published

### Recommended visible state per slot

```text
EMPTY
WORKING
VARIANTS
SELECTED
FINAL
PUBLISHED
```

Where available, show:

- selected asset
- number of variants
- current version
- producing tool
- latest modification
- blocker/readiness state

### Simple / Full

Project Builder should retain:

- **Simple** — compact lifecycle + essential asset slots + handoffs
- **Full** — complete Projects Content Asset Engine

Both must operate on the same ContentBuild.

---

## 10. Project Builder target anatomy

### Header
- Toolbox title: Project Builder / Project Planning
- project identity color when a project is active
- CHANNEL / PROJECT toggle in header
- NEW PROJECT action in header
- normal collapse control

### Project command
- working title
- project name
- Project status
- ContentBuild stage
- ContentBuild linked/pending state
- readiness
- asset count
- revision
- publish target
- lifecycle step indicator

### Project identity
- name
- publish date
- format
- status
- priority
- project color

### Project brief
- central concept
- audience promise
- target audience
- creator goal
- hook / angle
- visual style
- narrative style
- relevant constraints/references as the system grows

### Video package working fields
- title
- description
- tags
- script
- notes

### Packaging
- thumbnail preview
- current selected thumbnail identity
- variants/status when available
- Open Thumbnail Studio
- Open Vault
- clear / replace through canonical asset selection rules

### Planning
- Project To-Do
- Project Goals
- add manually
- complete
- dates for tasks
- AI Brain generation
- evidence/rationale on generated suggestions

### Schedule context
Do not duplicate a second full calendar inside Builder.

Builder should show compact scheduling context:

- project target date
- nearest deadlines/tasks
- nearby scheduled projects
- unscheduled warning
- Open Full Calendar

Project Board -> Calendar remains the full scheduling surface.

---

## 11. Project Board target

Project Board owns pipeline organization, not detailed content editing.

It should own:

- production lanes
- drag/drop movement
- priority
- owner/team metadata
- Board search/filter
- archive visibility
- Board / Calendar mode
- project selection/opening

When a card is opened:

1. select canonical Project,
2. select its ContentBuild,
3. switch Project Builder to Project mode,
4. return/focus Project Builder.

Board lane moves must update Project status and synchronize ContentBuild stage.

---

## 12. New Project transaction

New Project is one shared creation flow used by Builder and Board.

Initial form should support:

- project name
- working video title
- initial concept / one-line idea
- format
- target publish date
- priority
- project color

Later optional additions:

- initial thumbnail / reference image
- source idea / audience request
- series/theme
- target audience
- selected workflow template

### Transaction requirements

On successful create:

1. Create Project.
2. Create/resolve ContentBuild.
3. Store `Project.contentBuildId`.
4. Initialize project workspace metadata.
5. Initialize default Video Package using the same `contentBuildId`.
6. Select the new project.
7. Open Builder in Project mode.
8. Append provenance/event records where supported.

Do not create the Project and leave its ContentBuild/Video Package identity for a later screen to guess.

---

## 13. Video Package identity and persistence contract

The normal Project creation/recovery path now uses one canonical identity transaction:

```text
Project
  -> ProjectContentIdentityService
  -> create/resolve ContentBuild
  -> persist Project.contentBuildId
  -> find/reuse or initialize Video Package
  -> require the SAME contentBuildId
```

### Code-backed invariants on the audited main

- `ProjectContentIdentityService` centralizes Project → ContentBuild → Video Package initialization/recovery.
- `VideoPackageRepository` rejects normal saves without canonical ContentBuild identity and rejects a Project package scoped to a conflicting ContentBuild.
- Package writes carry the observed ContentBuild revision and reject stale writes rather than overwriting newer canonical state.
- `VideoPackageContentBuildBridge` synchronizes package-owned durable artifacts into ContentBuild and projects canonical selections back into the package.
- Title/thumbnail options use ContentBuild VariantGroups; selected and final remain distinct states.
- Explicit approval/finalization is required before a selected candidate becomes final.
- Legacy identity fallback is migration compatibility, not the normal save contract.

### Required invariant

```text
Project.contentBuildId
=
VideoPackage.contentBuildId
=
Asset.contentBuildId
=
Editor/Publisher scope.contentBuildId
```

A mismatch is an error condition. No surface may silently choose or create a second ContentBuild.

### Directional reconciliation rule

```text
Video Package owned specification/state -> ContentBuild
ContentBuild canonical selections/finals -> Video Package projection
```

Selection/finalization commands mutate canonical ContentBuild state first; projections must not become a competing selection store.

---

## 14. Publishing integration

The Project Builder should not duplicate the full Publisher UI.

It should provide a compact Publishing Package summary showing:

- title readiness
- thumbnail readiness
- description/tags
- audience
- visibility
- category
- schedule
- captions
- routing/end-screen state
- approval/readiness
- blockers

Then expose contextual actions:

- Edit Package
- Open Video Publisher
- Open Full Asset Engine
- Resolve Blocker

The full publishing implementation remains owned by the existing Asset Engine / Publisher systems.

### Publication freeze still required

Before external publication, the system must create an immutable approved-publish snapshot containing the ContentBuild ID + revision, exact final render/title/thumbnail/caption asset IDs, metadata/routing/visibility/schedule, approver/timestamp, and snapshot hash. The audited main has a Publishing Package projection but does **not** yet have a code-backed `ApprovedPublishSnapshot` implementation. Treat that snapshot plus a resumable/idempotent PublishTransaction as an open target, not shipped behavior.

---

## 15. Specialist-tool handoff contract

When Builder launches a specialist tool, the handoff should preserve:

- `contentBuildId`
- `projectId`
- `channelId`
- relevant selected assets
- relevant evidence IDs
- source tool
- requested action
- trace/provenance metadata when available

Destination tools should attach their outputs to the same ContentBuild and return receipts/handoffs rather than only mutating unrelated local state.

Priority integrations:

1. Script Architect
2. Storyboard Studio
3. Thumbnail Studio
4. Video Director
5. Editor
6. Packaging / SEO
7. Video Publisher
8. Vault
9. Pre-Launch / community
10. Analytics / evaluation

---

## 16. YouTube and post-publish lifecycle

The content object does not end at upload.

The ContentBuild already supports YouTube binding with:

- videoId
- canonical URL
- upload/schedule/publish timestamps
- visibility/state
- initial title asset
- initial thumbnail asset
- final render asset
- last verification

After publication, continue recording:

- title changes
- thumbnail changes
- experiment variants
- analytics checkpoints
- comments/replies when connected to workflow
- evaluation
- learning candidates

The purpose is to know not only what was published, but **which exact assets and decisions produced the measured result**.

---

## 17. Current bugs / architectural gaps

### Projects page fragmentation
**Status:** RESOLVED / PR #302  
The Projects page now uses Project Builder + Project Board/Calendar + Storyboard Studio as its top-level hierarchy. Former Channel Planning, full Asset Engine, Publishing Schedule and legacy Project Studio capabilities are embedded or routed from those owners rather than mounted as competing top-level toolboxes.

### Header toggle placement
**Status:** MERGED / PR #309  
PR #302 restored CHANNEL / PROJECT inside Builder body. The current follow-up branch moves that control into the main Project Builder Toolbox header and makes the header the single scope owner.

### Project creation identity transaction
**Status:** PRESENT ON AUDITED MAIN  
`ProjectContentIdentityService` now centralizes New Project and active-project recovery. It creates/resolves ContentBuild first, attaches `Project.contentBuildId`, then initializes/reuses a Video Package only against that same ContentBuild. Disconnected mode can still resolve Project + ContentBuild while package creation waits for channel scope.

### Thumbnail ownership
**Status:** MERGED PR #312 + FOLLOW-UP HARDENING IN PROGRESS  
PR #312 added canonical Vault-backed thumbnail selection in Project Packaging. The current follow-up makes ContentBuild the single thumbnail-selection owner, mirrors that selection into the Project Video Package when channel scope exists, preserves selection even while disconnected, restricts candidates to project/build assets plus reusable unscoped thumbnail assets, and lets a legacy URL be imported into Vault before selection.

### Simplified Asset Engine
**Status:** MERGED / PR #309; VISUAL CERTIFICATION OPEN  
The lifecycle launcher is on main. The current follow-up branch adds durable asset-slot projection for script, storyboard, title, thumbnail, description, tags/SEO and final video, including EMPTY / LEGACY / WORKING / VARIANTS / SELECTED / FINAL states.

### Calendar duplication / ownership
**Status:** MERGED / PR #309; VISUAL CERTIFICATION OPEN  
Target is one full calendar under Project Board plus compact schedule context in Builder. Do not restore two independently owned calendars.

### Publishing Package summary
**Status:** MERGED / PR #309; VISUAL CERTIFICATION OPEN  
Project Builder now has a compact publishing readiness summary for title, thumbnail, description, tags/SEO, category, audience, visibility and schedule, plus unresolved Video Package blockers and direct Publisher navigation.

### Project workspace metadata
**Status:** PARTIAL  
Lane/priority/owner/tags use local workspace metadata. Core content identity must remain in Project/ContentBuild and must not depend on workspace local storage.

### Status vocabulary
**Status:** PRESENT ON AUDITED MAIN  
Project status, Board lane, ContentBuild stage and Video Package status are related but intentionally not identical. The current branch centralizes those translations in `projectLifecycleVocabulary.ts`, keeps Board `blocked` orthogonal to lifecycle progression so blocking a project does not reset ContentBuild stage, and treats the ContentBuild -> Video Package mapping as descriptive only. Actual Video Package transitions remain governed by `VIDEO_PACKAGE_TRANSITIONS`.

### Legacy generation paths
**Status:** MIGRATE  
Some Project Studio strategy/storyboard generation still uses legacy direct generation services. Move durable outputs through current Brain/Asset Engine/handoff patterns without removing creator functionality.

### Project UI primitive consistency
**Status:** MIGRATE / CERTIFY  
Project Builder and Board must use current canonical Toolbox/Subtoolbox primitives and current UI authority. Do not copy obsolete legacy styling from preserved sources.

## 24. Project page feature opportunity intake — 2026-09-27

**Canonical catalog:** \`docs/architecture/PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE.md#projects-opportunities\`  
**Status:** OPPORTUNITY / FUTURE DEVELOPMENT INPUT.

1. **IDEA-PROJ-001 — Project Command Board:** unify Builder + Board command state around lifecycle, readiness, assets, blockers, tasks, publish target and ContentBuild.
2. **IDEA-PROJ-002 — Smart Project Templates:** reusable stages, briefs, asset requirements, checklists, tool links and AI instructions.
3. **IDEA-PROJ-003 — Project Readiness Engine:** explicit readiness/blocker evaluation across research, script, media, metadata, thumbnail, policy/legal and publishing requirements.
4. **IDEA-PROJ-004 — Dependency & Blocker Graph:** show what unfinished tasks/assets/decisions/generations/approvals prevent downstream work.
5. **IDEA-PROJ-005 — Project Memory:** governed project-scoped decisions, versions, rejected directions, research, style choices, prompts and lessons without a parallel memory silo.
6. **IDEA-PROJ-006 — Project Timeline:** chronological projection of project events, AI work, files, edits, generations, renders, publishing changes and analytics links.
7. **IDEA-PROJ-007 — Project Intelligence Panel:** project-scoped evidence-backed recommendations through BrainRuntime/Channel Knowledge.
8. **IDEA-PROJ-008 — Multi-Video Campaigns:** group Projects into series/campaigns/playlists/courses/launches/experiment programs while preserving individual Project identity.
9. **IDEA-PROJ-009 — Version & Experiment Manager:** alternative scripts, edits, titles, thumbnails, hooks, cuts, prompts and packages with lineage/outcomes.
10. **IDEA-PROJ-010 — Post-Publish Learning Loop:** bind measured publication outcomes and validated lessons back to the originating Project/ContentBuild and governed learning.

### Projects integration rule

These extend the existing Project/ContentBuild/Video Package/Asset Engine/publishing spine. They must not introduce a second project identity, second ContentBuild, or independent analytics/learning store. Promote exact work through the normal task program and keep the \`IDEA-PROJ-*\` ID attached until disposition.
