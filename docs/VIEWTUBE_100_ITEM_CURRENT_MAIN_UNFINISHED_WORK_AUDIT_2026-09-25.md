Reconciled against current main, recent PR/branch history, project memory, Library resources, living docs and production-readiness evidence

**Date: September 25, 2026 \| Repository: themotionvisual/ViewTubeBUILD \| Planning/audit only**

| **Authority rule: current main wins. Older PRs, branches, chats and prototypes are donors unless they contain a missing capability that has not been superseded. This report intentionally excludes several historical “missing” items that current main has already absorbed.** |

# 100-Item Quick Index

A compact copy of the full list. Each item below includes only its number, title, and a very brief explanation; the complete status, evidence, dependencies, implementation path, and definition of done remain in the detailed entries later in this document.

| # | Item | Very brief explanation |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | ApprovedPublishSnapshot runtime binding | the safety boundary that prevents a retry or last-minute edit from silently publishing different inputs than the creator approved. |
| 2 | Publish retry and recovery receipts | Publishing is an irreversible external action; duplicate uploads or lost remote IDs are high-cost failures. |
| 3 | Post-publish ContentBuild identity continuity | later analytics and learning cannot know which exact package, render, title or thumbnail actually produced the measured result. |
| 4 | Remote YouTube verification and reconciliation | Local success is not sufficient if YouTube rejected, transformed, or partially applied settings. |
| 5 | Publisher outcome writer | The system cannot learn from publish decisions if it only records asset generation and algorithm-specific events. |
| 6 | Dashboard Video Publisher identity migration | A public-ID rename without migration can lose layouts, duplicate widgets, or leave two competing surfaces. |
| 7 | Publisher capability parity: Dashboard vs Studio | Creators should not lose capabilities when switching surfaces or create incompatible drafts. |
| 8 | Video Manager capability parity: Dashboard vs Studio | Two managers with divergent save semantics are a direct source of stale metadata and overwrite bugs. |
| 9 | Video Manager rollback/retry and dirty-state model | Editing published content is consequential; users need to know what changed locally, what was saved, and what the remote platform… |
| 10 | Launch Package / Flight Check final consolidation | A single readiness surface prevents duplicate checklists and contradictory “ready” states. |
| 11 | Asset Slot Registry | A slot registry gives scripts, thumbnails, renders, captions and supporting assets one typed destination instead of ad-hoc fields. |
| 12 | Asset Engine Studio production surface | Creators need one production workspace for generating, comparing, selecting, versioning and routing assets without duplicating… |
| 13 | Creator Vault remaining production lanes | Vault is the durable creator asset memory layer; partial lane coverage leaves media types and workflows inconsistent. |
| 14 | Vault import deduplication and provenance | Duplicate media wastes storage and breaks selection history; missing provenance weakens AI evidence and rights tracking. |
| 15 | Vault Quick Look + canonical media player integration | One shared player avoids separate playback, scrubbing, metadata and keyboard behavior across Vault, Editor and Analyzer. |
| 16 | Project facade and Context Resolver recipes | Every downstream tool needs the same project/contentBuild/video identity without reconstructing context from UI state. |
| 17 | Project completion and abandonment outcomes | Project behavior is valuable evidence about which plans, tasks and workflows actually lead to completed uploads. |
| 18 | ContentBuild revision graph and audit history | A revision graph makes undo, comparison, provenance, publish freeze and AI learning safer. |
| 19 | Video Package variant lineage | Lineage is required for later “which title/thumbnail/render won?” analysis and safe variant comparison. |
| 20 | Cross-surface handoff identity continuity | Context loss when switching tools causes duplicate selection, wrong project edits and fragile URL guessing. |
| 21 | Brain active Project Context Adapter | Project-aware advice is necessary for specific creator decisions and prevents generic recommendations. |
| 22 | Opportunity Intelligence production evidence builder | Opportunity scoring must be explainable and grounded rather than invented in the UI or prompt. |
| 23 | Opportunity Radar / Intelligence UI convergence | One opportunity surface should visualize current opportunity data without creating a second intelligence engine. |
| 24 | Unified outcome writer contract | A common contract prevents duplicate ledgers and enables one evaluation/learning loop. |
| 25 | Evaluation-target coverage matrix | Without explicit targets, outcomes cannot be measured reliably and learning becomes anecdotal. |
| 26 | Governed learning promotion expansion | Durable learning must improve over time without overfitting one comment, one anomaly or one successful upload. |
| 27 | End-to-end Brain evidence ID propagation | Evidence IDs must survive specialist engines to the final answer so confidence/caveats and creator inspection are truthful. |
| 28 | Evidence Explorer / evidence-health view | Creators need to see why advice is strong, stale, missing, permission-blocked or contradictory. |
| 29 | Editable Channel Knowledge map | The creator needs a safe way to confirm, correct, expire and inspect durable channel facts instead of treating AI memory as opaque. |
| 30 | Style Fingerprint creator view | A visual fingerprint makes the channel-style model teachable and useful for thumbnails, scripts and packaging. |
| 31 | Diff-as-teaching correction signal | The difference between AI draft and creator-approved asset is stronger style feedback than generic ratings. |
| 32 | Variant Comparator | Creators need a grounded way to compare titles/thumbnails/scripts/renders on style, evidence and rubric dimensions without fake scores. |
| 33 | Universal “Why?” evidence trace | Users should be able to inspect evidence and decision provenance wherever the system recommends an action. |
| 34 | Creator-safe Trace Timeline | A timeline helps debug what input, tool, evidence and action occurred without exposing hidden reasoning. |
| 35 | Impact Cards and calibration chart | Calibration makes confidence meaningful only when enough measured history exists. |
| 36 | Versioned AI regression corpus [NEW / NECESSARY] | Without stable cases, prompt/model/context changes can quietly regress groundedness, safety, formatting or usefulness. |
| 37 | Prompt registry runtime reachability classification | A registry is only useful if every production generator is known, versioned and traceable to a caller. |
| 38 | Prompt constitution versioning and migration | Versioning prevents silent behavior drift and makes evaluation, rollback and provenance possible. |
| 39 | Task-specific context recipes | Different tasks need different channel/project/evidence context; dumping everything harms accuracy and privacy. |
| 40 | Structured AI outputs + deterministic validators | Schemas make AI output safer to route, compare, version and test; deterministic math should never be delegated to free-form prompts. |
| 41 | Canonical metric comparability validator | Incorrect comparisons can generate confident but false creator advice and invalid evaluations. |
| 42 | Metric guard integration into visual controllers | A central validator has no value if charts and widgets can bypass it. |
| 43 | Analytics checkpoint -\> evaluation bridge | This bridge closes the loop from recommendation/publish decision to actual measured creator outcome. |
| 44 | Analytics metric/dimension registry completeness | Missing registry metadata causes ad-hoc queries, inconsistent units and UI gaps. |
| 45 | CSV / report augmentation production importer | Import-only metrics can materially improve analytics without polluting canonical API sync ownership. |
| 46 | Imported analytics join by video ID | Without deterministic identity joins, imported metrics can attach to the wrong video or remain unusable. |
| 47 | Country / state / city / DMA mapping completion | Geographic analysis is a high-value creator insight and a common source of dimension/API edge cases. |
| 48 | Retention schema/table/sync hardening | Retention is one of the strongest content-quality signals and directly feeds packaging/content decisions. |
| 49 | Canonical time-window and lifecycle-window semantics | Mixing calendar windows with “days since publish” produces misleading comparisons. |
| 50 | Deep Dive analytics tables completion | Detailed tables remain essential when charts hide exact values, missingness or dimensions. |
| 51 | Traffic-source grouping and anomaly semantics closure | The remaining risk is stale legacy grouping logic or documentation reintroducing the old error. |
| 52 | Missingness and coverage UX | Blank charts are easily mistaken for zero performance and weaken trust. |
| 53 | Shorts vs long-form metric semantics | Creator decisions are distorted when fundamentally different formats are compared as if identical. |
| 54 | Analytics provenance drawer | Creators and developers need to know where a number came from, when it was synced and what transformations were applied. |
| 55 | Data Visual mobile/narrow/desktop certification | Charts that clip, resize incorrectly or lose controls on phones undermine the main product promise. |
| 56 | Data Visual renderer extraction / CSS ownership | Clear ownership reduces cascade regressions and makes visual modules independently testable. |
| 57 | Large-dashboard analytics performance budgets [NEW / NECESSARY] | High-volume channel data can make otherwise-correct dashboards unusable on mobile or older hardware. |
| 58 | Canonical final render asset | The render must be the same durable asset that downstream publishing, provenance and outcomes reference. |
| 59 | Preview-to-final render parity fixtures | Preview fidelity is core to editing trust; mismatches only discovered after export are expensive. |
| 60 | Four-layout editor certification | Editing is layout-dense and failures often appear only on specific phone orientation or desktop width. |
| 61 | Canonical transition component system | Transitions are a highly visible timeline primitive and prior duplicate experiments created design/code drift. |
| 62 | Mobile timeline minimap | A minimap can make long timelines navigable on small screens without sacrificing two-layer editing space. |
| 63 | Mobile editor feature parity | Mobile is a primary use case and cannot remain a reduced or brittle editor. |
| 64 | FX/keyframe shared-contract certification | One shared contract prevents the same effect from looking different in control UI, preview and export. |
| 65 | Single Remotion composition interpretation path | Parallel preview/render semantics are the root cause of visual drift and difficult debugging. |
| 66 | Render worker progress/error/recovery model | Long renders must survive errors/reloads and tell the creator whether work can resume or must restart. |
| 67 | Canonical media player adoption across creator surfaces | A shared player reduces duplicated playback state, accessibility bugs and inconsistent controls. |
| 68 | Veo 3.1 production provider adapter | A provider adapter would let ViewTube use advanced video generation without baking provider-specific logic into Editor/Brain. |
| 69 | Localization, dubbing and lipsync workflow [NEW / NECESSARY] | Localization can extend reach and repurposing while keeping outputs inside the same asset/provenance system. |
| 70 | Transcript + waveform compound system | Transcript-synced navigation supports editing, captions, chaptering and analysis with one reusable interaction model. |
| 71 | Chapter Navigator + annotation marker system | Structured markers make review, chapters, notes and collaborator/AI cues addressable by time. |
| 72 | Asset Intake Dock + Batch Selection compounds | Shared compounds can prevent each Studio tool from re-implementing upload, selection, progress and batch action UX. |
| 73 | Daily Oracle specific-target recommendation engine | The most useful “next move” is about a real video/project, not generic channel advice. |
| 74 | Absorb useful Next Best Action capabilities into Daily Oracle | This reduces widget overlap while preserving high-value decision logic. |
| 75 | Retire Next Best Action with persisted-layout migration | Retiring duplicate widgets reduces cognitive load and code ownership ambiguity without losing user layouts. |
| 76 | Dashboard Top-10 cohort final certification | Feature consolidation is not finished until each widget works across intended sizes, states and mobile layouts. |
| 77 | WidgetRenderer extraction and registry-driven rendering | A registry-driven renderer makes widgets easier to remove, migrate, lazy-load and test. |
| 78 | Widget CSS ownership split and legacy override removal | Global override debt is a recurring cause of components changing ratio, text size or color unexpectedly. |
| 79 | Shared Brain/dashboard selectors and narrow subscriptions | Large global subscriptions increase rerender cost and make UI state harder to reason about. |
| 80 | Persisted widget visibility/settings schema migrations | Without versioned migration, widget renames and defaults can erase user layout/preferences. |
| 81 | Studio capability-parity certification harness expansion | A visually consistent tool can still be functionally incomplete or use the wrong backend owner. |
| 82 | Finish migration of remaining Studio controls to canonical primitives | Mixed control systems cause dropdown bugs, geometry drift and inconsistent mobile behavior. |
| 83 | Legacy UStube / Reference Studio cleanup | Legacy naming and prototypes can confuse agents, developers and CSS ownership even when not user-facing. |
| 84 | Quick Switcher exact-identity continuity | Fast navigation is most useful when the destination opens the current video/project/contentBuild rather than a generic page. |
| 85 | Application-wide responsive + accessibility certification | Local fixes can regress adjacent screens; a single certification matrix is needed before calling the app shippable. |
| 86 | Canonical auth/session/channel-readiness error model | Conflated auth errors cause sign-out loops, misleading “not connected” states and difficult support. |
| 87 | OAuth / YouTube route consolidation regression closure | Duplicate routes and stale callers are a high-risk source of mobile connection failures. |
| 88 | Permanent production diagnostics + Copy Bug Report | Fast diagnosis is essential in a rapidly moving app with mobile/browser/deployment-specific failures. |
| 89 | Correlation IDs across request/tool/action pipelines [NEW / NECESSARY] | Cross-system failures are hard to debug when auth, sync, Brain, generation, publishing and UI actions cannot be joined. |
| 90 | External-write idempotency framework [NEW / NECESSARY] | Duplicate comments, uploads, updates or generation jobs can cost money and damage user trust. |
| 91 | Durable server authority for browser-persisted critical state [NEW / NECESSARY] | LocalStorage/browser-only state can be lost, diverge across devices or undermine recovery guarantees. |
| 92 | Quality budgets and zero-new-failure release gates | Rapid PR volume makes regressions inevitable without explicit budgets and baseline-aware gates. |
| 93 | End-to-end creator loop success + failure certification | Component-level success does not prove the product works as one creator operating system. |
| 94 | Staging/production deployment certification | A correct merge is not useful if the wrong project/environment is deployed or mobile receives stale assets. |
| 95 | Documentation authority lifecycle and stale-doc cleanup | Distributed documentation authority is a Create State known issue and a major agent-context hazard. |
| 96 | PR/branch donor + supersession ledger | Without a ledger, future agents repeatedly rediscover or attempt to merge stale work. |
| 97 | Resource Library + widget/HTML reference catalog completion | A searchable reference atlas prevents valuable design/function donors from being lost or reimplemented from memory. |
| 98 | Public agent-readiness surface [NEW / NECESSARY] | AI agents cannot reliably discover, cite or understand the public product/docs even though internal agent workflows are central to… |
| 99 | Valid OpenAPI + well-known protocol endpoint cleanup [NEW / NECESSARY] | False-positive protocol endpoints mislead agents and integrations more than a clean 404. |
| 100 | Agent work receipts + ADR-lite + living backlog automation [NEW / NECESSARY] | High parallel-agent throughput needs durable “started/completed/changed/verified” records or work is duplicated and decisions are lost. |

# Executive Summary

The main finding is that ViewTube is no longer primarily missing foundations. Between September 22 and 25, many older backlog claims were overtaken by merged work: Project/ContentBuild/Video Package convergence, Video Package→ContentBuild synchronization, Brain evidence and anomaly reachability, channel-scoped Brain controls, outcome attribution/evaluation/learning foundations, Studio primitive authority, mobile editor containment, Vault production routing, and major dashboard widget consolidation. The remaining highest-value work is concentrated in completion seams: frozen publishing intent and recovery, post-publish identity, uniform outcome/evaluation coverage, metric comparability, real Project/Opportunity context in Brain, final editor/render parity, Dashboard/Studio capability parity, application-wide certification, durable state/idempotency/observability, documentation authority, and public agent readability.

Top execution principle: finish and connect canonical owners before adding new surface area. New capability is justified only when no current owner exists or a reliability gap cannot be solved by convergence.

# 10 Prompt Enhancements Applied Before Building the 100-Item List

**1.** Add a priority score based on impact, dependency centrality, risk and creator value.

**2.** Name the canonical owner/system for every item so implementation does not create duplicate architecture.

**3.** Attach evidence references: PRs, branches, docs, code paths, tests or historical resources.

**4.** Show dependencies/blockers and what downstream work each item unlocks.

**5.** Assign a recommended action type: finish, connect, merge, replace, remove, consolidate, certify, document, migrate, redesign or build.

**6.** Add confidence levels that distinguish verified current-main facts from historical plans, inferred needs and speculative improvements.

**7.** Define testable “definition of done” acceptance criteria for every item.

**8.** Perform duplicate/supersession analysis so newer implementations replace stale historical backlog claims.

**9.** Cluster the 100 items into implementation waves rather than leaving a flat list.

**10.** State the value if completed and cost of leaving unfinished so priority reflects both opportunity and risk.

# Source Map and Reconciliation Method

| **Current main + code**            | themotionvisual/ViewTubeBUILD; current-main code searches resolved against the current connector snapshot; canonical current authority files include docs/architecture/VIEWTUBE_FINISH_PROGRAM_2026-09-24.md and tasks/viewtube-finish-program/BACKLOG-REGISTRY.md.                                                                    |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Recent PR/branch history**       | The most recent 150 PRs were inventoried. Recent merges \#388-#433 materially supersede many older backlog items; closed-unmerged PRs are treated as donors/superseded unless current main lacks their capability.                                                                                                                     |
| **Library / historical resources** | ViewTube_Unfinished_Work_Master_Resource_2026-09-11.docx; ViewTube_AI_System_Audit_and_Activation_Plan_2026-09-17.md; ViewTube_25_Recent_Conversations_All_Distinct_Objectives.docx; unified Project and Video Editor/AI/Veo/Remotion research resources; widget/dashboard and analytics reference artifacts.                          |
| **Create State**                   | Active ViewTube world model: current priorities include work receipts, ADR-lite, quality budgets, semantic metric types, correlation IDs, explicit state machines and end-to-end success/failure testing; known issues include AI regression corpus, observability, idempotency, browser-persistence risk and documentation authority. |
| **Agent Ready**                    | Live viewtube.live scan: 31/100 overall, llms.txt 0/100, strong basic accessibility but poor machine-readable/public static discoverability.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **HeyGen capability inventory**    | No existing HeyGen templates were found in the connected workspace. Translation/lipsync/clipping/speech/filler-removal capabilities are treated as optional provider opportunities, not assumed core requirements.                                                                                                                     |
| **Deep Research app**              | The dedicated Deep Research connector was not callable in this session; the audit was performed directly against the connected evidence sources instead of claiming a research session had started.                                                                                                                                    |

## Confidence Rules

High = verified by current-main authority, recent merged PRs or current code paths. Medium = supported by historical resources and partial current evidence but still needs targeted code confirmation. Low = inferred/new capability whose value is credible but whose final product scope should be validated before implementation.

# Important Supersession Findings

\#407 shared FX contract -\> superseded by merged \#408 shared FX implementation.

\#402 editor parity foundation -\> superseded by merged \#405 parity foundation v2.

\#308 Brain evidence/anomaly fix -\> superseded by merged \#310 rebased fix.

\#328 VT-SYNC/account isolation recovery -\> superseded by merged \#329 isolated recovery.

\#301 dashboard publishing widgets donor -\> useful capability recovered into later merged \#325/#304-era work rather than merged directly.

\#285 Daily Oracle redesign donor -\> substantially overtaken by \#409 Creator Command→Daily Oracle and \#413 intelligence consolidation.

\#425 Creator Vault plan explicitly marked SUPERSEDED; implementation truth is \#426 plus donor re-harvest \#428 and Lane A repair \#429.

Historical “Video Package→ContentBuild has no caller” claim is obsolete: current main calls syncVideoPackageToContentBuild from VideoPackageRepository before persistence.

Historical “BrainHub evidencePack.items missing / anomaly scanner unreachable” claims are obsolete: typed evidence projection and anomaly reachability were subsequently connected and are on the current finish program’s “do not reopen” list.

Historical “mobile editor orientation preservation” and “Studio primitive authority” are now foundations to certify, not greenfield programs.

# 10 Highest-Leverage Immediate Actions

**1. ApprovedPublishSnapshot runtime binding** — Contract exists; production binding incomplete.

**2. Publish retry and recovery receipts** — Resumable transaction foundation exists; failure-path certification incomplete.

**3. Post-publish ContentBuild identity continuity** — Partially designed; production writers incomplete.

**41. Canonical metric comparability validator** — Policy landed; reusable validator implementation/integration still open.

**21. Brain active Project Context Adapter** — Explicitly open in current finish program.

**22. Opportunity Intelligence production evidence builder** — Opportunity engine exists; deterministic production feed incomplete.

**24. Unified outcome writer contract** — Ledgers exist; producer contract uneven.

**58. Canonical final render asset** — Editor/ContentBuild foundations exist; final render identity closure incomplete.

**88. Permanent production diagnostics + Copy Bug Report** — Partially built historically; needs guaranteed production presence.

**93. End-to-end creator loop success + failure certification** — Pieces are tested; one complete loop remains finish criterion.

# 100-Item Master Backlog

### 1. ApprovedPublishSnapshot runtime binding

**Publishing \| Status: Contract exists; production binding incomplete \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: Publisher / ContentBuild \| Priority: 100/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 1**

**Work already done / code & resources:** PR \#420 landed an immutable approved-publish snapshot contract. The finish program still calls for transactions, retries, and later edits to bind to that frozen identity. Evidence: PR \#420; docs/architecture/VIEWTUBE_FINISH_PROGRAM_2026-09-24.md; PublishTransaction / PublishingPackageProjection.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** This is the safety boundary that prevents a retry or last-minute edit from silently publishing different inputs than the creator approved.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Canonical Video Package + ContentBuild revision; final asset IDs; Publisher transaction.

**Implementation / integration path:** Implement the runtime snapshot creator, durable hash/idempotency key, and make PublishTransaction reference the snapshot rather than mutable form state.

**Definition of done:** A retry after reload reproduces the exact approved title, thumbnail, render, metadata, schedule and audience settings from one immutable snapshot.

### 2. Publish retry and recovery receipts

**Publishing \| Status: Resumable transaction foundation exists; failure-path certification incomplete \| Action: CERTIFY \| Owner: Publisher / YouTube transport \| Priority: 99/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 1**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Resumable PublishTransaction is already a canonical foundation, but optional-step retry, remote-ID survival, and durable receipts remain finish-program work. Evidence: VIEWTUBE_FINISH_PROGRAM F7; current PublishTransaction services; release-gate work in PR \#311.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Publishing is an irreversible external action; duplicate uploads or lost remote IDs are high-cost failures.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Item 1; canonical YouTube transport; durable external-write receipt format.

**Implementation / integration path:** Make each step idempotent, persist the remote video ID immediately, split optional retries from core upload, and expose explicit manual-recovery states.

**Definition of done:** Interruption fixtures prove the same YouTube video is resumed, not duplicated, and each failed optional step can retry independently.

### 3. Post-publish ContentBuild identity continuity

**Publishing \| Status: Partially designed; production writers incomplete \| Action: CONNECT \| Owner: ContentBuild / Publisher / Analytics \| Priority: 99/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 1**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Project, ContentBuild, Video Package and publishing identities now converge, but the post-publish binding and analytics checkpoints are not yet complete across the full loop. Evidence: PRs \#293, \#313, \#321, \#322, \#326; finish program F8.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Without this link, later analytics and learning cannot know which exact package, render, title or thumbnail actually produced the measured result.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Items 1-2; YouTube binding; analytics checkpoint writer.

**Implementation / integration path:** Persist YouTube video binding and lifecycle events on the same ContentBuild, then attach analytics checkpoints and later outcome/evaluation records to it.

**Definition of done:** One fixture traces Project -\> ContentBuild -\> Video Package -\> Approved snapshot -\> YouTube ID -\> analytics checkpoints -\> measured outcome.

### 4. Remote YouTube verification and reconciliation

**Publishing \| Status: Core transport exists; reconciliation coverage incomplete \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: YouTube transport / Publisher \| Priority: 96/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 1**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Current workflows can publish and manage YouTube-bound content, but remote verification and reconciliation need one explicit canonical pass after writes and retries. Evidence: Finish-program publish recovery requirements; Video Manager/Publisher parity plans; PR \#430 mobile Video Manager restructure.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Local success is not sufficient if YouTube rejected, transformed, or partially applied settings.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Items 1-3; OAuth readiness; canonical account/channel state.

**Implementation / integration path:** After every consequential write, read the authoritative remote state, compare against the approved snapshot, and persist structured mismatch/recovery results.

**Definition of done:** Automated tests cover exact match, partial mismatch, permission failure, stale auth, and already-applied retry cases.

### 5. Publisher outcome writer

**Outcomes \| Status: Generic outcome infrastructure exists; Publisher coverage incomplete \| Action: CONNECT \| Owner: BrainOutcomeLedger / Publisher \| Priority: 97/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 2**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Brain outcome/evaluation infrastructure is strong after PRs \#393-399, but finish-program F3 still lists Publisher as a priority producer without uniform outcome coverage. Evidence: PRs \#393-399; VIEWTUBE_FINISH_PROGRAM F3/F4; publishing services.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** The system cannot learn from publish decisions if it only records asset generation and algorithm-specific events.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Items 1-4; unified outcome writer contract (item 24).

**Implementation / integration path:** Emit idempotent publish outcomes with channel/project/contentBuild/snapshot/action/evidence IDs and measurable checkpoints.

**Definition of done:** Every approved publish, cancelled publish, retry and verified completion produces exactly one canonical outcome chain.

### 6. Dashboard Video Publisher identity migration

**Publishing UI \| Status: Planned; current public ID still requires migration confirmation \| Action: MIGRATE \| Owner: Dashboard registry / Publisher \| Priority: 91/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 2**

**Work already done / code & resources:** The current backlog authority calls for \`video-uploader\` to become \`video-publisher\` with persisted-layout migration, not a simple label change. Evidence: BACKLOG-REGISTRY Program A; PR \#325 recovery; PR \#304 Studio publisher primitive work.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** A public-ID rename without migration can lose layouts, duplicate widgets, or leave two competing surfaces.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Dashboard schema version; registry; renderer; storage migration.

**Implementation / integration path:** Add alias normalization, carry order/hidden/instances/size/collapse state, update registry/renderer/docs/tests, then remove the visible old ID.

**Definition of done:** Legacy layouts containing \`video-uploader\` normalize to exactly one \`video-publisher\` with preserved state.

### 7. Publisher capability parity: Dashboard vs Studio

**Publishing UI \| Status: Both surfaces exist; capability ownership not fully proven equal \| Action: CONSOLIDATE \| Owner: Publisher domain model \| Priority: 94/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 2**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Dashboard and Studio both expose publishing jobs, but the backlog requires a row-by-row parity audit against one backend owner. Evidence: BACKLOG-REGISTRY Programs A/B; src/views/VideoPublisher.tsx; dashboard publishing widget; PRs \#304/#325.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Creators should not lose capabilities when switching surfaces or create incompatible drafts.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Items 1-6; shared publishing workspace model/actions/validation.

**Implementation / integration path:** Create a parity matrix for source package, metadata, thumbnail, schedule, captions, approval, blockers, retry, YouTube binding, verification, provenance and handoffs.

**Definition of done:** Every supported publisher capability maps to the same persisted backend truth on both surfaces, with independent UI shells only.

### 8. Video Manager capability parity: Dashboard vs Studio

**Video Management \| Status: Both surfaces exist; parity not certified \| Action: CONSOLIDATE \| Owner: Video Manager domain owner \| Priority: 93/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 2**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Video Manager was repeatedly recovered/restructured and now uses canonical mobile primitives, but Dashboard/Studio backend parity is still an explicit follow-on program. Evidence: PR \#430; PR \#325; BACKLOG-REGISTRY Program B.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Two managers with divergent save semantics are a direct source of stale metadata and overwrite bugs.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Canonical selected video + remote metadata snapshot + update service.

**Implementation / integration path:** Share selection/edit/save view models and operation owners while keeping Dashboard WidgetShell and Studio Toolbox layouts separate.

**Definition of done:** A save in one surface immediately reflects in the other and both expose the same supported fields, error recovery and remote confirmation.

### 9. Video Manager rollback/retry and dirty-state model

**Video Management \| Status: Partially implemented; recovery semantics need completion \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: Video Manager / YouTube transport \| Priority: 87/100 \| Confidence: Medium \| Wave 2**

**Work already done / code & resources:** The current parity plan names dirty state, rollback/retry/error presentation, provenance and last-synced state as required shared capabilities. Evidence: BACKLOG-REGISTRY Program B; PR \#430.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Editing published content is consequential; users need to know what changed locally, what was saved, and what the remote platform accepted.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Item 8; remote verification item 4.

**Implementation / integration path:** Add a canonical edit session with base remote snapshot, diff, optimistic UI, durable save receipt and explicit rollback/reload behavior.

**Definition of done:** Tests prove dirty tracking, successful save, failed save, stale remote state, retry and rollback without data loss.

### 10. Launch Package / Flight Check final consolidation

**Publishing \| Status: Consolidation landed in widgets; end-to-end authority needs certification \| Action: CERTIFY \| Owner: Publisher / Flight Check \| Priority: 84/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 2**

**Work already done / code & resources:** PR \#418 consolidated Publishing Command into Flight Check, but the finished system still needs one launch-readiness owner tied to the approved package and transaction. Evidence: PR \#418; top-10 widget program; publisher backlog.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** A single readiness surface prevents duplicate checklists and contradictory “ready” states.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Items 1, 6-8; package validation services.

**Implementation / integration path:** Bind Flight Check to the canonical package/snapshot blockers and remove any remaining local or duplicate publishing-readiness calculations.

**Definition of done:** Flight Check reports the same blockers as Publisher, routes fixes to exact owners, and cannot show ready while the canonical package is blocked.

**Supersession / duplicate note:** Publishing Command is superseded by Flight Check; do not recreate it as a separate widget.

### 11. Asset Slot Registry

**Asset Engine \| Status: Planned in expanded finish registry; partial concepts exist \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: Asset Engine / ContentBuild \| Priority: 88/100 \| Confidence: Medium \| Wave 3**

**Work already done / code & resources:** ContentBuild and Asset Engine now have a canonical lifecycle spine, but the expanded backlog still calls for a formal slot registry for required/optional assets and selections. Evidence: PR \#293; PR \#322; finish-program expanded Project/Asset/Publish registry.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** A slot registry gives scripts, thumbnails, renders, captions and supporting assets one typed destination instead of ad-hoc fields.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Canonical ContentBuild schema and versioned asset store.

**Implementation / integration path:** Define typed slot IDs, cardinality, requiredness, accepted asset kinds, selection/version semantics and migration from legacy fields.

**Definition of done:** All package-building surfaces resolve assets through the same registry and tests reject invalid slot/asset combinations.

### 12. Asset Engine Studio production surface

**Asset Engine \| Status: Backend/widget foundations exist; full creator workspace incomplete \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: Asset Engine \| Priority: 86/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 3**

**Work already done / code & resources:** The ContentBuild spine and Video Asset Engine dashboard widget exist, but the finish registry still lists Asset Engine Studio as a completion target. Evidence: PR \#293; PR \#286; PR \#414 lifecycle consolidation.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Creators need one production workspace for generating, comparing, selecting, versioning and routing assets without duplicating backend state.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Item 11; Vault; Project/ContentBuild identity.

**Implementation / integration path:** Build the Studio surface as a view over canonical Asset Engine services, with generation receipts, variants, provenance, selections and send-to flows.

**Definition of done:** Every asset action is addressable by ContentBuild/slot/version, works on mobile, and produces a reusable canonical asset rather than UI-only state.

### 13. Creator Vault remaining production lanes

**Vault \| Status: Production route + Import Station + Lane A repairs landed; broader donor scope incomplete \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: Creator Vault \| Priority: 88/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 3**

**Work already done / code & resources:** PRs \#426, \#428 and \#429 established the production Vault route, re-harvested the donor and repaired Lane A selection/import/Quick Look. Other donor capabilities remain to be reconciled. Evidence: PRs \#426/#428/#429; Vault-Tool donor; current Vault docs/code.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Vault is the durable creator asset memory layer; partial lane coverage leaves media types and workflows inconsistent.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Asset Engine identity, media primitives, storage/provenance.

**Implementation / integration path:** Apply the donor-harvest matrix lane-by-lane, port only missing capability, and retain canonical Toolbox/asset ownership rather than donor styling/state.

**Definition of done:** All intended asset kinds have production add/search/tag/note/select/preview/route behavior and pass mobile/desktop QA.

**Supersession / duplicate note:** PR \#425 planning artifact is superseded by \#426/#428/#429 and should not be treated as a fresh build plan.

### 14. Vault import deduplication and provenance

**Vault \| Status: Import Station exists; durable dedupe/provenance needs stronger guarantees \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: Vault / Asset Engine \| Priority: 85/100 \| Confidence: Medium \| Wave 3**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Batch import, memory, search/tags and smart-filter concepts were donor requirements; production import now exists but needs canonical duplicate detection and source lineage. Evidence: PR \#426; Vault donor plan; asset identity services.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Duplicate media wastes storage and breaks selection history; missing provenance weakens AI evidence and rights tracking.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Canonical asset hash/ID; metadata extractor; item 11.

**Implementation / integration path:** Hash content, preserve source/import batch, record derivation and duplicate relationship, and make merge/keep-both choices explicit.

**Definition of done:** Re-importing identical bytes does not silently create a second canonical asset; variants retain traceable source lineage.

### 15. Vault Quick Look + canonical media player integration

**Vault / Media \| Status: Quick Look repaired and media primitives landed; cross-surface integration incomplete \| Action: CONNECT \| Owner: Vault / Media Player \| Priority: 78/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 3**

**Work already done / code & resources:** PR \#429 repaired Quick Look and PR \#427 added a canonical media player plus 15 media primitives. Evidence: PR \#427; PR \#429.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** One shared player avoids separate playback, scrubbing, metadata and keyboard behavior across Vault, Editor and Analyzer.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Media player component contract; asset URLs/version identity.

**Implementation / integration path:** Replace Vault-specific playback shells with the canonical player/compound controls and preserve current asset selection context.

**Definition of done:** All supported media preview types use the shared player contract with correct controls, loading/error states and mobile touch behavior.

### 16. Project facade and Context Resolver recipes

**Projects \| Status: Project/ContentBuild consolidation landed; complete facade/context recipes remain \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: Projects / ContentBuild \| Priority: 91/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 3**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Projects were rebuilt around canonical identity in PRs \#302/#309/#313/#322/#326. The finish registry still names a complete Project facade and destination context recipes as open. Evidence: PRs \#302/#309/#313/#322/#326; one-goal plan.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Every downstream tool needs the same project/contentBuild/video identity without reconstructing context from UI state.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Canonical Project model, ContentBuild repository, ActionPacket handoff.

**Implementation / integration path:** Expose one read/write facade and explicit context recipes for Publisher, Editor, Vault, Brain, Studio and dashboard destinations.

**Definition of done:** Each major destination can hydrate from an ID packet alone and no route independently mutates legacy project/package state.

### 17. Project completion and abandonment outcomes

**Projects / Outcomes \| Status: Project workflow exists; outcome coverage incomplete \| Action: CONNECT \| Owner: Projects / BrainOutcomeLedger \| Priority: 84/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 4**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Finish-program F3 explicitly lists Project completion/abandonment as missing outcome producers. Evidence: VIEWTUBE_FINISH_PROGRAM F3; Project lifecycle vocabulary PR \#331.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Project behavior is valuable evidence about which plans, tasks and workflows actually lead to completed uploads.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Item 24; project lifecycle state machine.

**Implementation / integration path:** Emit outcome events for stage completion, abandonment, reopen and publish handoff using project/contentBuild/action IDs.

**Definition of done:** Lifecycle transitions create one canonical, idempotent outcome stream that Channel/Brain Intelligence can consume.

### 18. ContentBuild revision graph and audit history

**ContentBuild \| Status: Versioned stores exist; complete creator-visible revision graph is partial \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: ContentBuild \| Priority: 82/100 \| Confidence: Medium \| Wave 4**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Video Package persistence is versioned and ContentBuild is canonical, but the user-facing revision/audit model remains fragmented. Evidence: PR \#321; PR \#322; Asset Engine services.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** A revision graph makes undo, comparison, provenance, publish freeze and AI learning safer.

**Dependencies / blockers:** ContentBuild revision identity; Asset Engine versioning; Approved snapshot.

**Implementation / integration path:** Normalize revisions into a graph with parent/reason/actor/changed-slot metadata and expose read-only history to Projects/Asset Engine.

**Definition of done:** Any published or selected asset state can be traced to a specific revision, diffed, and restored without rewriting history.

### 19. Video Package variant lineage

**Video Package \| Status: Canonical store exists; lineage/provenance depth incomplete \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: Video Package / Asset Engine \| Priority: 80/100 \| Confidence: Medium \| Wave 4**

**Work already done / code & resources:** The package store is versioned, but variant origin, selection rationale and relationship to generated alternatives are not yet consistently first-class. Evidence: PR \#321; package bridges; generator receipts.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Lineage is required for later “which title/thumbnail/render won?” analysis and safe variant comparison.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Item 18; outcome/evaluation identity.

**Implementation / integration path:** Persist parent variant, generation request/receipt, selected/unselected state and exact slot binding for each package revision.

**Definition of done:** Analytics and evaluation can join a result back to the exact used variant and its alternatives.

### 20. Cross-surface handoff identity continuity

**Workflow \| Status: Action/handoff infrastructure exists; complete ID continuity needs certification \| Action: CERTIFY \| Owner: ActionPacket / Tool Capability registry \| Priority: 89/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 4**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Project, Vault, Editor, Dashboard and Studio increasingly share canonical identities, and PR \#404 restored ranked handoff preference learning. Evidence: PR \#404; SendToMenu; Project/ContentBuild identity work.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Context loss when switching tools causes duplicate selection, wrong project edits and fragile URL guessing.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Project facade item 16; tool capability registry.

**Implementation / integration path:** Require ActionPackets to carry known channelId/projectId/contentBuildId/videoPackageId/videoId/asset IDs and validate destination compatibility.

**Definition of done:** All major handoffs preserve applicable IDs and target tools open to the exact source selection without user re-selection.

### 21. Brain active Project Context Adapter

**Brain / Context \| Status: Explicitly open in current finish program \| Action: CONNECT \| Owner: BrainRuntime / Projects \| Priority: 98/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 5**

**Work already done / code & resources:** BrainRuntime and channel knowledge are production foundations, but active project/contentBuild context is not consistently supplied to portfolio construction. Evidence: VIEWTUBE_FINISH_PROGRAM F1; PRs \#386/#388-#399; project context docs.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Project-aware advice is necessary for specific creator decisions and prevents generic recommendations.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Project facade item 16; allowProjects control; bounded context policy.

**Implementation / integration path:** Resolve active project metadata through canonical owners and pass bounded context into Algorithm Intelligence/BrainRuntime only when allowed.

**Definition of done:** Brain tests show project-specific recommendations when permitted and zero project leakage when disabled.

### 22. Opportunity Intelligence production evidence builder

**Brain / Intelligence \| Status: Opportunity engine exists; deterministic production feed incomplete \| Action: CONNECT \| Owner: Opportunity Intelligence / analytics-canon \| Priority: 98/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 5**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Opportunity Radar foundation landed, but current finish authority still calls for a deterministic opportunity-evidence builder with provenance, freshness and missing-evidence behavior. Evidence: PR \#406; VIEWTUBE_FINISH_PROGRAM F2; current Opportunity Intelligence services.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Opportunity scoring must be explainable and grounded rather than invented in the UI or prompt.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Canonical analytics evidence, item 41 metric guard, channel scope.

**Implementation / integration path:** Build typed evidence records from canonical data and feed them into Algorithm Intelligence only when enabled.

**Definition of done:** Every surfaced opportunity has evidence IDs, scope, freshness, confidence and deterministic behavior under missing/stale data.

### 23. Opportunity Radar / Intelligence UI convergence

**Brain / Widgets \| Status: Radar foundation landed; multiple concepts need convergence \| Action: CONSOLIDATE \| Owner: Opportunity Intelligence / Dashboard \| Priority: 82/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 6**

**Work already done / code & resources:** PR \#406 created the foundation and PR \#411 connected Anomaly Radar to canonical intelligence; older Opportunity Radar plans remain donor material. Evidence: PRs \#406/#411; PR241 donor audit; widget consolidation docs.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** One opportunity surface should visualize current opportunity data without creating a second intelligence engine.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Item 22; widget primitive/certification system.

**Implementation / integration path:** Use current backend view models, absorb only useful spatial impact/effort visuals, and remove duplicate widget logic.

**Definition of done:** A single registered surface renders canonical opportunities, routes actions, and has no local recommendation engine.

**Supersession / duplicate note:** Treat earlier standalone Opportunity Radar implementations as donors, not separate future products.

### 24. Unified outcome writer contract

**Outcomes / AI \| Status: Ledgers exist; producer contract uneven \| Action: CONSOLIDATE \| Owner: BrainOutcomeLedger / domain outcome owners \| Priority: 98/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 5**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Outcome attribution, measured evaluation and governed learning matured in PRs \#393-399, but F3 still calls for uniform coverage across Publisher, Editor, Projects, Comments, experiments and packaging. Evidence: PRs \#393-399; VIEWTUBE_FINISH_PROGRAM F3.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** A common contract prevents duplicate ledgers and enables one evaluation/learning loop.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Existing BrainOutcomeLedger, Algorithm event ledger, ContentBuild events.

**Implementation / integration path:** Define producer mapping, required identity fields, idempotency keys and domain-specific outcome kinds without creating a new generic store.

**Definition of done:** Coverage matrix shows a production caller for every priority producer and zero duplicate writes in retry tests.

### 25. Evaluation-target coverage matrix

**Evaluation \| Status: Infrastructure exists; consequential-action target coverage incomplete \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: Algorithm Intelligence / Analytics \| Priority: 97/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 5**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Measured evaluation infrastructure landed, but not every recommendation/priming/action declares metrics, checkpoints, scope and expected direction. Evidence: PRs \#395-399; VIEWTUBE_FINISH_PROGRAM F4.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Without explicit targets, outcomes cannot be measured reliably and learning becomes anecdotal.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Item 24; metric comparability item 41; analytics checkpoints.

**Implementation / integration path:** Inventory every consequential action and attach target schema or explicit not_measurable/insufficient_data state.

**Definition of done:** Every action class is either measurably evaluated or intentionally marked non-measurable with reason; silent gaps are rejected.

### 26. Governed learning promotion expansion

**Learning \| Status: Core governed promotion exists; broader producer/contradiction coverage incomplete \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: Algorithm Learning Profile \| Priority: 94/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 5**

**Work already done / code & resources:** PRs \#398/#399 require creator confirmation or repeated evidence and preserve validated learning, but finish-program F5 still calls for contradiction/expiry and broader producer coverage. Evidence: PRs \#398/#399; AlgorithmLearningProfilePromotion.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Durable learning must improve over time without overfitting one comment, one anomaly or one successful upload.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Items 24-25; measured evidence; creator controls.

**Implementation / integration path:** Extend candidate generation, contradiction detection, expiry/revalidation and review UI while keeping direct memory writes blocked.

**Definition of done:** Conflicting evidence downgrades or expires learned claims; no one-off action directly promotes durable knowledge.

### 27. End-to-end Brain evidence ID propagation

**Brain / Provenance \| Status: Typed evidence exists; continuity through all specialists/UI needs certification \| Action: CERTIFY \| Owner: Brain evidence contract \| Priority: 91/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 5**

**Work already done / code & resources:** PR \#383 established the evidence contract; PR \#384 fixed missingness; Brain Hub projection/anomaly connection is already complete. Evidence: PRs \#383/#384/#310; BrainHubWidget evidence projection.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Evidence IDs must survive specialist engines to the final answer so confidence/caveats and creator inspection are truthful.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Existing typed evidence projections; trace IDs.

**Implementation / integration path:** Audit each specialist and response builder for evidence-ID preservation and remove invented provenance labels.

**Definition of done:** A traced answer can enumerate exact evidence records from source through response and UI drawer with no broken IDs.

### 28. Evidence Explorer / evidence-health view

**Brain UX \| Status: Backend evidence quality exists; creator-facing view largely unbuilt \| Action: BUILD \| Owner: Brain Hub \| Priority: 79/100 \| Confidence: Medium \| Wave 6**

**Work already done / code & resources:** PR241 donor audit retained Evidence Explorer as a useful feature now that evidence quality, missingness and provenance exist. Evidence: PR241_DONOR_HARVEST_AUDIT; evidence contract PRs \#383/#384.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Creators need to see why advice is strong, stale, missing, permission-blocked or contradictory.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Item 27; Toolbox/UI primitives.

**Implementation / integration path:** Build a compact evidence-health toolbox using typed evidence, freshness, scope, missingness and permission reasons; do not expose hidden reasoning.

**Definition of done:** Each recommendation can open a readable evidence view showing sources, freshness and blocks without chain-of-thought.

### 29. Editable Channel Knowledge map

**Brain / Knowledge \| Status: Typed Channel Knowledge runtime exists; creator correction UI incomplete \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: Channel Knowledge / Brain Hub \| Priority: 84/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 6**

**Work already done / code & resources:** PRs \#386/#388-#390 implemented typed task-scoped Channel Knowledge and deterministic resolution; PR241 retained an editable Knowledge Map concept. Evidence: PRs \#386/#388/#389/#390; PR241 donor audit.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** The creator needs a safe way to confirm, correct, expire and inspect durable channel facts instead of treating AI memory as opaque.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Governed learning item 26; source/provenance model.

**Implementation / integration path:** Expose fact/source/confidence/expiry/contradiction controls backed by current Channel Knowledge, not a second memory store.

**Definition of done:** Creator edits produce governed knowledge updates with provenance and audit history; rejected facts stop influencing later tasks.

### 30. Style Fingerprint creator view

**Brain / Style \| Status: Style metrics/profile exist; explanatory UI incomplete \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: StyleProfile / Channel Knowledge \| Priority: 72/100 \| Confidence: Medium \| Wave 7**

**Work already done / code & resources:** PR241 donor audit retained Style Fingerprint because styleProfile/styleMetrics already exist. Evidence: PR241 donor audit; current style/profile services.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** A visual fingerprint makes the channel-style model teachable and useful for thumbnails, scripts and packaging.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Channel Knowledge; asset evaluation signals.

**Implementation / integration path:** Create a comparison/teaching view over existing metrics with evidence and uncertainty, avoiding invented precision.

**Definition of done:** Creators can inspect dimensions, supporting examples and confidence and compare a candidate asset against the learned profile.

### 31. Diff-as-teaching correction signal

**Brain / Learning \| Status: Correction outcomes exist in pieces; creator-facing teaching workflow incomplete \| Action: CONNECT \| Owner: Asset outcomes / Channel Knowledge \| Priority: 76/100 \| Confidence: Medium \| Wave 7**

**Work already done / code & resources:** PR241 retained diff-as-teaching because asset edit outcomes can encode high-value creator corrections. Evidence: PR241 donor audit; Asset Engine variant/edit outcomes.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** The difference between AI draft and creator-approved asset is stronger style feedback than generic ratings.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Items 24/26; versioned assets/revisions.

**Implementation / integration path:** Compute structured differences from selected creator edits, ask for confirmation where needed, and feed validated signals into learning candidates.

**Definition of done:** A correction can be traced from asset diff to candidate learning, creator confirmation and later use; raw edits never silently become memory.

### 32. Variant Comparator

**AI / Asset Engine \| Status: Concept retained; backend prerequisites largely exist \| Action: BUILD \| Owner: Asset Engine / Evaluation \| Priority: 75/100 \| Confidence: Medium \| Wave 7**

**Work already done / code & resources:** PR241 retained Variant Comparator as a fit for governed generation and package-first selection. Evidence: PR241 donor audit; Asset Engine generator receipts; Video Package variants.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Creators need a grounded way to compare titles/thumbnails/scripts/renders on style, evidence and rubric dimensions without fake scores.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Items 19, 27, 40; asset slot/variant lineage.

**Implementation / integration path:** Build a reusable comparison model driven by typed rubric/evidence fields and creator selection, then write selection outcomes.

**Definition of done:** Two or more variants can be compared with explainable dimensions; the selected variant and rationale become canonical outcome data.

### 33. Universal “Why?” evidence trace

**Brain UX \| Status: Trace/evidence foundations exist; cross-surface affordance incomplete \| Action: CONNECT \| Owner: BrainTrace / UI primitives \| Priority: 82/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 7**

**Work already done / code & resources:** PRs \#393 and evidence-contract work provide traceable answers; PR241 retained a universal Why/evidence trace affordance. Evidence: PR \#393; PR241 donor audit.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Users should be able to inspect evidence and decision provenance wherever the system recommends an action.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Item 27; evidence drawer; ActionPacket identity.

**Implementation / integration path:** Add a shared “Why?” compound control that opens creator-safe evidence/trace summaries across Daily Oracle, Brain Hub, Radar and recommendations.

**Definition of done:** All high-value recommendations expose source/evidence/confidence/caveat data without revealing private chain-of-thought.

### 34. Creator-safe Trace Timeline

**Brain / Observability \| Status: BrainTrace exists; simplified UI not finished \| Action: BUILD \| Owner: BrainTrace / Brain Hub \| Priority: 68/100 \| Confidence: Medium \| Wave 7**

**Work already done / code & resources:** PR241 retained a trace timeline as operator-first; current traces are useful but not yet a polished creator view. Evidence: PR \#393; PR241 donor audit.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** A timeline helps debug what input, tool, evidence and action occurred without exposing hidden reasoning.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Correlation IDs item 89; trace schema.

**Implementation / integration path:** Project only safe events: request, evidence fetch, tool call/receipt, recommendation, action, outcome, evaluation.

**Definition of done:** Timeline renders joinable safe events with timestamps/IDs and can export a support bundle.

### 35. Impact Cards and calibration chart

**AI Evaluation \| Status: Deferred until outcome coverage is sufficient \| Action: BUILD \| Owner: Evaluation / Dashboard \| Priority: 58/100 \| Confidence: Medium \| Wave 9**

**Work already done / code & resources:** PR241 explicitly deferred this until prediction/recommendation identity joins enough measured outcomes. Evidence: PR241 donor audit; outcome/evaluation PRs \#393-399.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Calibration makes confidence meaningful only when enough measured history exists.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Items 24-25, 43; minimum sample/coverage rules.

**Implementation / integration path:** Define sample thresholds, then plot predicted confidence/impact against measured outcomes with uncertainty and cohort filters.

**Definition of done:** Chart refuses underpowered cohorts and demonstrates statistically honest calibration once coverage thresholds are met.

### 36. Versioned AI regression corpus **\[NEW / NECESSARY\]**

**AI Quality \| Status: Newly identified necessity; not complete \| Action: BUILD \| Owner: AI quality / Prompt System \| Priority: 92/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 5**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Create State explicitly identifies the lack of a versioned AI regression corpus as a known issue; prompt modernization also requires rich/sparse/empty/stale/disabled fixtures. Evidence: Create State ViewTube world model; VIEWTUBE_PROMPT_IMPROVEMENT_PROGRAM.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Without stable cases, prompt/model/context changes can quietly regress groundedness, safety, formatting or usefulness.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Prompt registry item 37; evidence fixtures; evaluation harness.

**Implementation / integration path:** Create versioned representative tasks with frozen evidence inputs, expected invariants and scoring hooks; run on prompt/model changes.

**Definition of done:** CI can compare a candidate prompt/model stack to baseline across groundedness, schema validity, citation/evidence use and disabled/empty behavior.

### 37. Prompt registry runtime reachability classification

**Prompt System \| Status: Registry/docs exist; production reachability audit incomplete \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: Prompt System authority \| Priority: 91/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 5**

**Work already done / code & resources:** PR \#391 introduced a shared prompt constitution and the finish program promotes prompt modernization to first-class scope, including reachability classification. Evidence: PR \#391; docs/brain/VIEWTUBE_PROMPT_SYSTEM_AUTHORITY_2026-09-24.md; prompt registry JSON.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** A registry is only useful if every production generator is known, versioned and traceable to a caller.

**Dependencies / blockers:** AI regression corpus item 36; provider adapters.

**Implementation / integration path:** Inventory all production prompt/generator call sites, mark active/dead/donor/test-only, and bind prompt family/version IDs to runtime receipts.

**Definition of done:** No production prompt call exists outside the registry/constitution path, and dead legacy entries are removed or quarantined.

### 38. Prompt constitution versioning and migration

**Prompt System \| Status: Shared constitution landed; versioned migration policy incomplete \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: Prompt System authority \| Priority: 85/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 5**

**Work already done / code & resources:** PR \#391 landed the shared constitution, while the prompt finish plan requires prompt-family versions and provenance. Evidence: PR \#391; prompt improvement docs.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Versioning prevents silent behavior drift and makes evaluation, rollback and provenance possible.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Item 37; generation receipts.

**Implementation / integration path:** Assign semantic prompt family/version IDs, migration notes and compatibility rules; store version on each generation receipt.

**Definition of done:** Any generated asset/answer can report the prompt family/version and rollback to the prior approved version if regression tests fail.

### 39. Task-specific context recipes

**Prompt / Context \| Status: Some deterministic context resolution exists; full recipe registry incomplete \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: Context Resolver / Prompt System \| Priority: 88/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 5**

**Work already done / code & resources:** PR \#389 implemented a deterministic task Context Resolver, but prompt completion still calls for explicit task-specific context recipes and bounded personalization. Evidence: PR \#389; prompt improvement docs.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Different tasks need different channel/project/evidence context; dumping everything harms accuracy and privacy.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Items 21, 29, 37; user controls.

**Implementation / integration path:** Define context recipe IDs with required/optional sources, token budgets, privacy gates, freshness and missing-data behavior.

**Definition of done:** Every prompt family declares one recipe; tests prove only allowed relevant context is included under each control state.

### 40. Structured AI outputs + deterministic validators

**Prompt / Generation \| Status: Mixed coverage; high-value outputs still need convergence \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: Prompt System / domain services \| Priority: 90/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 5**

**Work already done / code & resources:** The prompt plan explicitly calls for structured outputs and deterministic calculations/validators outside prompts. Evidence: VIEWTUBE_PROMPT_IMPROVEMENT_PROGRAM; existing schema-driven AI work.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Schemas make AI output safer to route, compare, version and test; deterministic math should never be delegated to free-form prompts.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Prompt registry; domain schemas; AI regression corpus.

**Implementation / integration path:** Define schemas for high-value assets/actions, parse/validate strictly, move rankings/calculations to code, and record validation failures.

**Definition of done:** High-value generators return schema-valid outputs or explicit failures; deterministic fields are reproducible without the model.

### 41. Canonical metric comparability validator

**Analytics \| Status: Policy landed; reusable validator implementation/integration still open \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: analytics-canon \| Priority: 99/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 1**

**Work already done / code & resources:** PR \#419 added the canonical policy, while finish-program F9 requires one reusable guard across unit, aggregation, scope, format, time window, normalization and coverage. Evidence: PR \#419; VIEWTUBE_FINISH_PROGRAM F9.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Incorrect comparisons can generate confident but false creator advice and invalid evaluations.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Metric registry; VT-SYNC metadata; format/window semantics.

**Implementation / integration path:** Implement a structured validator returning machine-readable incompatibility reasons and tests for valid/invalid pairings.

**Definition of done:** No evaluation or comparison silently combines incompatible metrics; callers receive specific, testable rejection reasons.

### 42. Metric guard integration into visual controllers

**Analytics / Data Visual \| Status: Guard policy exists; controller enforcement incomplete \| Action: CONNECT \| Owner: Data Visual controllers / analytics-canon \| Priority: 93/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 4**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Finish-program F14 requires the comparability guard to be integrated into Data Visual and analytics comparison surfaces. Evidence: PR \#419; PRs \#289/#298 controller unification; F14.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** A central validator has no value if charts and widgets can bypass it.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Item 41; unified controller rails.

**Implementation / integration path:** Route every compare/benchmark toggle through the same validator and render incompatibility/missingness states rather than misleading charts.

**Definition of done:** Controller tests prove invalid combinations cannot render a comparative claim and valid ones preserve expected formatting.

### 43. Analytics checkpoint -\> evaluation bridge

**Analytics / Evaluation \| Status: Partially planned; full production continuity incomplete \| Action: CONNECT \| Owner: analytics-canon / Evaluation \| Priority: 96/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 4**

**Work already done / code & resources:** The finish program’s post-publish phase requires analytics checkpoints against the same ContentBuild to feed measured outcomes. Evidence: VIEWTUBE_FINISH_PROGRAM F8/F4; PRs \#397-399.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** This bridge closes the loop from recommendation/publish decision to actual measured creator outcome.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Items 3, 25, 41.

**Implementation / integration path:** Schedule or trigger canonical checkpoints at declared evaluation windows, join by ContentBuild/action/variant identity, and write measured outcomes.

**Definition of done:** A published fixture automatically reaches a measured evaluation when data becomes available, or explicit insufficient_data when it does not.

### 44. Analytics metric/dimension registry completeness

**Analytics \| Status: Substantial registry work exists; full coverage remains ongoing \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: VT-SYNC / analytics-canon \| Priority: 86/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 4**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Historical analytics plans repeatedly called for full metric/dimension coverage; docs consolidation and current registries exist, but completeness against supported YouTube data still needs certification. Evidence: Sept analytics task indexes; PR \#385 docs consolidation; VT-SYNC registries.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Missing registry metadata causes ad-hoc queries, inconsistent units and UI gaps.

**Dependencies / blockers:** VT-SYNC dataset inventory; policy item 41.

**Implementation / integration path:** Audit supported YouTube Analytics/Data API combinations against registry, mark supported/unsupported/import-only, and add tests for unit/scope/window metadata.

**Definition of done:** Every production dataset/metric has one canonical registry entry with source, dimensions, units, format applicability and coverage rules.

### 45. CSV / report augmentation production importer

**Analytics Import \| Status: Architecture planned; full production ingestion remains partial \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: Analytics Import / VT-SYNC \| Priority: 84/100 \| Confidence: Medium \| Wave 4**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Earlier single-video/geography work planned CSV/Google-report imports for metrics unavailable through APIs; this remains useful where API coverage is incomplete. Evidence: ViewTube 25 Recent Conversations objective; analytics unfinished-work resource.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Import-only metrics can materially improve analytics without polluting canonical API sync ownership.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Metric registry item 44; video identity; schema validation.

**Implementation / integration path:** Create a bounded importer with file schema detection, preview, validation, provenance, duplicate protection and explicit import-only source flags.

**Definition of done:** Supported reports import reproducibly, invalid columns fail clearly, and imported values remain distinguishable from API-synced facts.

### 46. Imported analytics join by video ID

**Analytics Import \| Status: Planned; production matching logic incomplete \| Action: CONNECT \| Owner: Analytics Import / Video catalog \| Priority: 81/100 \| Confidence: Medium \| Wave 4**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Historical plans explicitly called for joining imported report metrics to synced video records by video ID. Evidence: ViewTube 25 Recent Conversations objective; canonical video services.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Without deterministic identity joins, imported metrics can attach to the wrong video or remain unusable.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Item 45; canonical video inventory.

**Implementation / integration path:** Normalize IDs, detect channel mismatch, quarantine unknown videos, and preserve import batch/source provenance.

**Definition of done:** Every imported row is either deterministically joined, intentionally unmatched with reason, or rejected; no fuzzy silent match occurs.

### 47. Country / state / city / DMA mapping completion

**Analytics Geography \| Status: Mapping exists; broader completeness/certification remains \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: VT-SYNC Geography \| Priority: 77/100 \| Confidence: Medium \| Wave 4**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Historical work established country/DMA mapping plans and corrected state naming, while city/global/DMA coverage remained a recurring issue. Evidence: Analytics conversation resources; VT-SYNC geography datasets; UI/controller work.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Geographic analysis is a high-value creator insight and a common source of dimension/API edge cases.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Metric registry; dataset windows; API capability rules.

**Implementation / integration path:** Certify each geography dimension, DMA range strategy, fallback labels, privacy/coverage thresholds and UI drill-down behavior.

**Definition of done:** Country/state/city/DMA views either return validated data or a precise unsupported/insufficient-data state on all target windows.

### 48. Retention schema/table/sync hardening

**Analytics Retention \| Status: Major work exists; historical task index still records schema/sync gaps \| Action: CERTIFY \| Owner: VT-SYNC Retention \| Priority: 80/100 \| Confidence: Medium \| Wave 4**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Retention was a top unfinished analytics theme; later dashboard/visual work progressed, but end-to-end sync/table/schema correctness should be re-certified. Evidence: Analytics unfinished-work index; Shorts Retention visual work; VT-SYNC tables.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Retention is one of the strongest content-quality signals and directly feeds packaging/content decisions.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Canonical video duration/format; window rules.

**Implementation / integration path:** Audit row grain, percentage units, curve sampling, storage schema and table/view consumers; remove legacy derived alternatives.

**Definition of done:** Known fixture curves round-trip sync -\> store -\> table -\> chart with correct percentages and no format/window leakage.

### 49. Canonical time-window and lifecycle-window semantics

**Analytics \| Status: 7/28/90/365/lifetime support exists; consistency needs final certification \| Action: CERTIFY \| Owner: VT-SYNC / analytics-canon \| Priority: 87/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 4**

**Work already done / code & resources:** The system supports common windows and lifetime day-dimension rules, but comparability/evaluation correctness depends on one explicit lifecycle-window model. Evidence: VT-SYNC sync plans; finish-program F9; metric policy.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Mixing calendar windows with “days since publish” produces misleading comparisons.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Item 41; dataset registry.

**Implementation / integration path:** Tag each metric query/result with window type and anchor, enforce allowed conversions and expose lifecycle windows explicitly for video cohorts.

**Definition of done:** Tests cover calendar vs lifetime vs days-since-publish and reject comparisons with incompatible anchors.

### 50. Deep Dive analytics tables completion

**Analytics UI \| Status: Multiple table systems exist; full deep-dive production completeness remains \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: Analytics tables / Data Visual \| Priority: 71/100 \| Confidence: Medium \| Wave 8**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Historical task indexes called for deep-dive tables, scrollbars and table fixes while newer controller work focused on visuals. Evidence: Analytics task index; current table registry; Data Visual docs.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Detailed tables remain essential when charts hide exact values, missingness or dimensions.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Metric registry item 44; table registry; mobile performance.

**Implementation / integration path:** Converge tables on one registry, virtualize large row sets, add explicit sort/filter/export and align units/missingness with charts.

**Definition of done:** Each major dataset has a production table view with correct units, performant large-data behavior and mobile/narrow usability.

### 51. Traffic-source grouping and anomaly semantics closure

**Analytics / Anomaly \| Status: Historical PR \#78 semantics fixed in newer paths; legacy docs/paths need closure \| Action: REMOVE \| Owner: VT-SYNC / Anomaly Intelligence \| Priority: 63/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 8**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Old PR \#78 documentation records the \`term\` vs \`source\` grouping correction. Current main says anomaly scanner production reachability is already complete. Evidence: docs/migration/reference/PR_78_SAFE_MERGE_TO_MAIN_2026-09-03.md; finish program “do not reopen” list; PR \#310/#411.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** The remaining risk is stale legacy grouping logic or documentation reintroducing the old error.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Current anomaly scanner tests and traffic registry.

**Implementation / integration path:** Search all legacy selectors/docs for obsolete grouping assumptions, delete unreachable code, and retain one regression fixture.

**Definition of done:** No production code groups traffic terms under the wrong key and historical docs are clearly marked reference-only.

**Supersession / duplicate note:** Do not rebuild PR \#78 as a new feature; current anomaly reachability is already landed.

### 52. Missingness and coverage UX

**Analytics UX \| Status: Backend missingness improved; consistent user presentation incomplete \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: analytics-canon / Data Visual \| Priority: 82/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 6**

**Work already done / code & resources:** PR \#384 fixed invalid metric missingness in Brain evidence, but dashboards/tables also need a common language for unavailable, sparse, stale and permission-blocked data. Evidence: PR \#384; analytics/data visual docs; evidence contract.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Blank charts are easily mistaken for zero performance and weaken trust.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Metric registry coverage metadata; UI state primitives.

**Implementation / integration path:** Define shared missingness reason codes and render them consistently in charts, tables, widgets and Brain evidence.

**Definition of done:** Fixtures for empty/sparse/stale/unsupported/permission-blocked all produce distinct, readable states rather than zero-filled data.

### 53. Shorts vs long-form metric semantics

**Analytics \| Status: Format filters exist; semantic comparability needs central enforcement \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: analytics-canon \| Priority: 83/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 4**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Shorts Retention and dashboard filters are implemented concepts, but F9 explicitly requires Short-only/long-only/shared format compatibility. Evidence: Finish-program F9; Shorts Retention widget plans; metric registry.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Creator decisions are distorted when fundamentally different formats are compared as if identical.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Items 41/49; format classification.

**Implementation / integration path:** Add metric-level format applicability and cohort rules, and make controllers/evaluations reject or normalize incompatible format comparisons.

**Definition of done:** Format-specific fixtures prove valid shared metrics and block invalid cross-format comparisons.

### 54. Analytics provenance drawer

**Analytics UX \| Status: Provenance exists in services; unified inspection UI incomplete \| Action: BUILD \| Owner: Analytics / Evidence UI \| Priority: 69/100 \| Confidence: Medium \| Wave 7**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Analytics provenance has been a recurring requirement and is increasingly available through canonical evidence and import source metadata. Evidence: User Guide/provenance work; evidence contracts; import plans.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Creators and developers need to know where a number came from, when it was synced and what transformations were applied.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Items 44/45/52; Why/evidence control item 33.

**Implementation / integration path:** Create a reusable provenance detail view with dataset, source, query grain, window, sync time, transform, coverage and IDs.

**Definition of done:** Any displayed high-value metric can open a provenance record that resolves to its canonical source and freshness.

### 55. Data Visual mobile/narrow/desktop certification

**Data Visual \| Status: Controller/canvas work landed; broad responsive certification incomplete \| Action: CERTIFY \| Owner: Data Visual / UI QA \| Priority: 86/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 8**

**Work already done / code & resources:** PRs \#289/#298 unified controller rails; docs include mobile QA matrices, but current finish authority still calls for full mobile/narrow/desktop visual regression certification. Evidence: PRs \#289/#298; docs/MOBILE_VISUAL_QA_MATRIX.md; finish-program F14.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Charts that clip, resize incorrectly or lose controls on phones undermine the main product promise.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Canonical primitive geometry; visual test harness.

**Implementation / integration path:** Capture representative datasets across 1440 desktop, narrow desktop, portrait and landscape; enforce aspect/controller rules and reduced-motion behavior.

**Definition of done:** No target chart clips labels/controls, aspect ratios are intentional, and screenshot regression baselines are green.

### 56. Data Visual renderer extraction / CSS ownership

**Data Visual Architecture \| Status: Partial consolidation landed; remaining shared-owner boundaries need cleanup \| Action: CONSOLIDATE \| Owner: Data Visual renderers \| Priority: 73/100 \| Confidence: Medium \| Wave 8**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Earlier widget/dashboard optimization plans called for renderer extraction, CSS split and narrow selectors; later PRs unified controllers but did not necessarily finish every architecture cleanup. Evidence: Widget/dashboard optimization resource; PR \#294 CSS ownership; PRs \#289/#298.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Clear ownership reduces cascade regressions and makes visual modules independently testable.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Data Visual registry; widget CSS isolation.

**Implementation / integration path:** Move remaining monolithic renderer/canvas code behind typed renderers and module-scoped CSS; delete shadowing legacy overrides after parity tests.

**Definition of done:** Import graph shows one owner per renderer/style family and changing one visualization does not alter unrelated widgets.

### 57. Large-dashboard analytics performance budgets **\[NEW / NECESSARY\]**

**Analytics Performance \| Status: Some virtualization/performance plans exist; formal budgets absent \| Action: BUILD \| Owner: Analytics UI / Performance \| Priority: 70/100 \| Confidence: Medium \| Wave 8**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Historical optimization plans mention virtualization/benchmarks, while Create State calls for quality budgets on changed surfaces. Evidence: Widget/dashboard optimization plan; Create State world model.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** High-volume channel data can make otherwise-correct dashboards unusable on mobile or older hardware.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Items 50/55/56; representative large datasets.

**Implementation / integration path:** Define render-time, memory and interaction budgets; virtualize large tables/lists; benchmark representative high-volume fixtures in CI.

**Definition of done:** Performance tests fail when agreed budgets regress and large-data views remain interactive on target mobile/desktop devices.

### 58. Canonical final render asset

**Editor \| Status: Editor/ContentBuild foundations exist; final render identity closure incomplete \| Action: CONNECT \| Owner: Video Editor / Asset Engine \| Priority: 96/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 6**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Editor parity work advanced in PRs \#405/#408/#410/#417, but finish-program F12 still requires render/export to produce a canonical derived asset/version selected by Publisher. Evidence: PRs \#405/#408/#410/#417; VIEWTUBE_FINISH_PROGRAM F12.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** The render must be the same durable asset that downstream publishing, provenance and outcomes reference.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Asset Slot Registry; ContentBuild; render worker.

**Implementation / integration path:** On successful export, create/version the canonical render asset, bind it to the correct ContentBuild slot and emit outcome/provenance events.

**Definition of done:** Publisher can select the exact editor render by stable asset/version ID and later analytics trace back to it.

### 59. Preview-to-final render parity fixtures

**Editor / Remotion \| Status: Rich fixtures exist; complete representative parity set incomplete \| Action: CERTIFY \| Owner: Editor / Remotion \| Priority: 94/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 6**

**Work already done / code & resources:** PR \#410 added a rich parity fixture and PR \#417 unified visual-frame semantics, but finish-program F13 still requires broad preview/final parity certification. Evidence: PRs \#410/#417; editor living authority PR \#400.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Preview fidelity is core to editing trust; mismatches only discovered after export are expensive.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Item 58; canonical composition semantics.

**Implementation / integration path:** Expand fixtures across transforms, transitions, text, templates, media, FX, timing and ratios, then compare preview model to render model.

**Definition of done:** Representative projects render within defined visual/temporal tolerances and failures identify the exact unsupported effect.

### 60. Four-layout editor certification

**Editor Mobile \| Status: Foundations landed; comprehensive desktop/narrow/portrait/landscape certification incomplete \| Action: CERTIFY \| Owner: Video Editor UI \| Priority: 90/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 8**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Mobile containment/orientation preservation is already “finished enough,” yet the finish program still calls for four-layout certification. Evidence: PR \#284; editor docs; finish program Phase 6.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Editing is layout-dense and failures often appear only on specific phone orientation or desktop width.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Canonical Toolbox primitives; item 59.

**Implementation / integration path:** Certify desktop, narrow, phone portrait and phone landscape with stable page position, timeline access, preview visibility and settings reachability.

**Definition of done:** All four layouts pass interaction/screenshot tests with no clipped panels, inaccessible controls or state loss on orientation change.

### 61. Canonical transition component system

**Editor UI \| Status: Many iterations + parity foundations; final accepted visual system still needs closure \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: Editor timeline / Transition system \| Priority: 78/100 \| Confidence: Medium \| Wave 8**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Historical conversations repeatedly iterated tapered connected transitions; PR \#405 now gives a parity foundation but the final component design needs one authoritative implementation. Evidence: ViewTube transition resources; PR \#405; editor authority docs.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Transitions are a highly visible timeline primitive and prior duplicate experiments created design/code drift.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Shared transition data contract; preview/render parity.

**Implementation / integration path:** Choose one canonical geometry/state contract, port best donor visuals, remove rejected duplicates, and certify edit/drag/select states.

**Definition of done:** One transition component renders consistently in timeline, preview and final output and old variants are quarantined or removed.

### 62. Mobile timeline minimap

**Editor Mobile \| Status: Historical plan/partial implementation; final behavior unresolved \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: Editor timeline \| Priority: 67/100 \| Confidence: Medium \| Wave 8**

**Work already done / code & resources:** The 25-conversation audit recorded a mobile-only timeline minimap at roughly partial progress; later editor work focused containment and parity but did not prove the final minimap experience. Evidence: ViewTube_25_Recent_Conversations_All_Distinct_Objectives; editor docs.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** A minimap can make long timelines navigable on small screens without sacrificing two-layer editing space.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Item 60; timeline viewport state.

**Implementation / integration path:** Implement as a view over the canonical timeline range/selection, with drag-to-pan, current viewport indicator and optional collapse.

**Definition of done:** Portrait/landscape tests prove minimap navigation, no accidental clip edits, and preserved position across rotation.

### 63. Mobile editor feature parity

**Editor Mobile \| Status: Substantial foundations; some desktop-only or broken controls likely remain \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: Video Editor UI \| Priority: 83/100 \| Confidence: Medium \| Wave 8**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Historical audits repeatedly found portrait cutoffs, hidden toggles, empty dropdowns and mismatched layouts; many fixes landed but parity should be closed systematically. Evidence: PR \#284/#295; editor mobile audits; PRs \#405-#417.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Mobile is a primary use case and cannot remain a reduced or brittle editor.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Item 60; primitive system; media controls.

**Implementation / integration path:** Generate a desktop-vs-mobile capability matrix and fix only true parity gaps, preserving mobile-specific composition where needed.

**Definition of done:** Every supported editor capability is reachable and functional on phone portrait/landscape or explicitly documented as intentionally desktop-only.

### 64. FX/keyframe shared-contract certification

**Editor \| Status: Shared FX work merged; broad migration/certification remains \| Action: CERTIFY \| Owner: Editor FX \| Priority: 82/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 8**

**Work already done / code & resources:** PR \#408 unified FX controls, preview, keyframes and final render after \#407’s standalone contract was closed unmerged. Evidence: PR \#408; PR \#407 superseded.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** One shared contract prevents the same effect from looking different in control UI, preview and export.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Item 59; effect registry.

**Implementation / integration path:** Audit every production effect/keyframe consumer against the shared contract, add missing migrations, then remove legacy adapters.

**Definition of done:** All registered FX pass control-\>preview-\>render round-trip fixtures with stable serialization.
**Supersession / duplicate note:** PR \#407 is superseded by the merged \#408 implementation.

### 65. Single Remotion composition interpretation path

**Editor / Remotion \| Status: Remotion assets recovered; final single-path convergence incomplete \| Action: CONSOLIDATE \| Owner: Remotion render architecture \| Priority: 88/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 6**

**Work already done / code & resources:** PR \#292 recovered the Remotion asset library; finish-program F13 requires one composition interpretation path rather than parallel timing models. Evidence: PR \#292; Remotion asset library docs; finish program F13.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Parallel preview/render semantics are the root cause of visual drift and difficult debugging.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Items 58/59/64.

**Implementation / integration path:** Define one canonical frame/timing/transform model consumed by preview and render adapters and deprecate parallel legacy timing logic.

**Definition of done:** A composition serialized once drives both preview and final render, and repository search finds no active second timing model.

### 66. Render worker progress/error/recovery model

**Editor Infrastructure \| Status: Render worker exists; deterministic recovery and progress UX need strengthening \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: Render worker / Editor \| Priority: 85/100 \| Confidence: Medium \| Wave 8**

**Work already done / code & resources:** A render-worker document exists and final certification calls for deterministic render/export errors and progress. Evidence: docs/vt-e1-render-worker.md; editor finish plan.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Long renders must survive errors/reloads and tell the creator whether work can resume or must restart.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Item 58; external-write/idempotency patterns.

**Implementation / integration path:** Persist job identity/progress/stage, normalize error codes, support retry where safe and bind output to canonical asset identity.

**Definition of done:** Render jobs expose deterministic progress and terminal states; retry/reload cannot create ambiguous duplicate outputs.

### 67. Canonical media player adoption across creator surfaces

**Media UI \| Status: Component landed; adoption incomplete \| Action: CONNECT \| Owner: Media Player component \| Priority: 75/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 8**

**Work already done / code & resources:** PR \#427 added a canonical media player and 15 primitives, but existing Vault, Editor, Analyzer and preview surfaces still need migration audit. Evidence: PR \#427; current media preview components.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** A shared player reduces duplicated playback state, accessibility bugs and inconsistent controls.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Item 15; Editor/Vault surfaces.

**Implementation / integration path:** Inventory all media playback implementations, migrate compatible ones to shared compounds, and retain specialized render surfaces only where necessary.

**Definition of done:** Repository audit shows one default media-player contract and all migrated surfaces pass keyboard/touch/loading/error tests.

### 68. Veo 3.1 production provider adapter

**AI Video \| Status: Provider-neutral plumbing exists; no production Veo 3.1 adapter verified \| Action: BUILD \| Owner: AI generation provider layer \| Priority: 61/100 \| Confidence: Medium \| Wave 9**

**Work already done / code & resources:** The unified Video Editor/AI/Veo/Remotion research notes provider-neutral generation plumbing but no verified production \`veo-3.1\` adapter. Evidence: Library file “ViewTube Unified Video Editor, AI, Veo, and Remotion Deep Research”; generation provider services.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** A provider adapter would let ViewTube use advanced video generation without baking provider-specific logic into Editor/Brain.

**Dependencies / blockers:** GenerationRequest/ToolReceipt; asset ingestion; cost/approval controls.

**Implementation / integration path:** Implement a provider adapter behind the existing generation contract, record model/version/cost/provenance and store results as canonical assets.

**Definition of done:** A generation request can target Veo through the standard provider interface, produce a receipt/asset, and fail safely without provider-specific UI state.

### 69. Localization, dubbing and lipsync workflow **\[NEW / NECESSARY\]**

**Creator Production \| Status: New optional capability; no current production workflow verified \| Action: BUILD \| Owner: Video production providers / Asset Engine \| Priority: 55/100 \| Confidence: Low \| Wave 9**

**Work already done / code & resources:** HeyGen capabilities available to the connected toolset include video translation, lipsync, speech, clipping and filler-word removal, but ViewTube has no consolidated provider-neutral localization workflow. Evidence: HeyGen capability inventory; Video production/repurposing plans.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Localization can extend reach and repurposing while keeping outputs inside the same asset/provenance system.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Asset Engine; provider adapters; creator approval; rights/voice consent.

**Implementation / integration path:** Add provider-neutral jobs for translate/dub/lipsync/cleanup with explicit consent, language metadata, cost and canonical output assets; HeyGen can be one adapter.

**Definition of done:** Localized outputs are versioned assets linked to the source, provider/voice/model metadata and creator approval; no automatic external publishing.

### 70. Transcript + waveform compound system

**Media / Editor \| Status: Prototype compound design exists; production integration incomplete \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: Media compounds / Editor \| Priority: 62/100 \| Confidence: Medium \| Wave 9**

**Work already done / code & resources:** A Compound Systems Lab planned Transcript+Wave as a reusable complex component. Evidence: Compound Systems Lab resource; media primitives PR \#427.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Transcript-synced navigation supports editing, captions, chaptering and analysis with one reusable interaction model.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Canonical transcript/caption data; media player.

**Implementation / integration path:** Build as a compound over shared player time state, searchable transcript tokens and marker API rather than a standalone editor state owner.

**Definition of done:** Clicking transcript seeks media, playback highlights text, edits preserve timestamps and the compound works at standard Toolbox sizes.

### 71. Chapter Navigator + annotation marker system

**Media / Editor \| Status: Prototype concepts exist; production compound incomplete \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: Media compounds / Editor \| Priority: 60/100 \| Confidence: Medium \| Wave 9**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Compound Systems Lab planned Chapter Navigator and Annotation+Marker Stack; these remain useful for long-form editing/review. Evidence: Compound Systems Lab resource; chapter/publisher metadata concepts.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Structured markers make review, chapters, notes and collaborator/AI cues addressable by time.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Item 70; media player; ContentBuild metadata.

**Implementation / integration path:** Create one time-marker model with marker kinds/labels/owners, then layer chapter navigation and annotation UI on it.

**Definition of done:** Markers round-trip through save/load, seek accurately and can project approved chapters into Publisher metadata.

### 72. Asset Intake Dock + Batch Selection compounds

**Media / Vault \| Status: Prototype compound concepts; partial Vault equivalents exist \| Action: CONSOLIDATE \| Owner: Vault / Studio compounds \| Priority: 64/100 \| Confidence: Medium \| Wave 9**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Compound Systems Lab proposed Asset Intake Dock and Batch Selection Tray; Vault Import Station now covers part of this job. Evidence: Compound Systems Lab; PR \#426 Import Station.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Shared compounds can prevent each Studio tool from re-implementing upload, selection, progress and batch action UX.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Vault Import Station; media primitives; asset identity.

**Implementation / integration path:** Extract only the reusable lower-level intake/batch-selection compounds from current Vault behavior; do not create a second importer.

**Definition of done:** Studio tools reuse the compounds while all persistence and dedupe remain owned by Vault/Asset Engine.

**Supersession / duplicate note:** Treat earlier intake prototypes as donors to the current Vault Import Station, not parallel storage systems.

### 73. Daily Oracle specific-target recommendation engine

**Dashboard / Intelligence \| Status: Foundation exists; specificity to real videos/projects remains a named follow-on \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: Daily Oracle Decision Engine \| Priority: 93/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 6**

**Work already done / code & resources:** PR \#409 consolidated Creator Command into Daily Oracle. The follow-on plan requires channel-, video-, project- and task-specific advice using canonical evidence. Evidence: PR \#409; BACKLOG-REGISTRY Program C; DailyOracleDecisionEngine.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** The most useful “next move” is about a real video/project, not generic channel advice.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Items 21-23; analytics evidence; project permissions.

**Implementation / integration path:** Extend the backend recommendation model with target identity, evidence, impact/effort/confidence/source and canonical route/handoff.

**Definition of done:** When target evidence exists, recommendations name real content and never invent unsupported facts; deterministic fallback remains available.

### 74. Absorb useful Next Best Action capabilities into Daily Oracle

**Dashboard / Intelligence \| Status: Planned; donor logic exists \| Action: MERGE \| Owner: Daily Oracle / Algorithm Intelligence \| Priority: 88/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 6**

**Work already done / code & resources:** The current follow-on explicitly keeps latest-video baseline logic, production-task readiness, top-performer follow-up and PR \#413 governed recommendation architecture, but moves them under Daily Oracle. Evidence: PR \#413; BACKLOG-REGISTRY Program C/D.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** This reduces widget overlap while preserving high-value decision logic.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Item 73; AlgorithmIntelligenceAccess; project context.

**Implementation / integration path:** Move/share backend logic first, add parity tests, then wire Daily Oracle UI to ranked alternatives and exact destination actions.

**Definition of done:** Every retained Next Best Action capability has a passing Daily Oracle test before the old widget is retired.

### 75. Retire Next Best Action with persisted-layout migration

**Dashboard Cleanup \| Status: Blocked on parity; not yet safe to delete \| Action: REMOVE \| Owner: Dashboard registry/storage \| Priority: 74/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 9**

**Work already done / code & resources:** The follow-on plan explicitly prohibits deletion until parity, then requires schema migration and cleanup of registry/renderer/CSS/docs. Evidence: BACKLOG-REGISTRY Program D.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Retiring duplicate widgets reduces cognitive load and code ownership ambiguity without losing user layouts.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Item 74; dashboard schema migration.

**Implementation / integration path:** Normalize stored layouts: merge/remove duplicate if Daily Oracle exists, otherwise replace slot while preserving supported state; then delete old implementation.

**Definition of done:** Registry and renderer contain no \`next-best-action\`, legacy layouts migrate deterministically, and no orphaned CSS/import/docs remain.

### 76. Dashboard Top-10 cohort final certification

**Dashboard Widgets \| Status: Multiple consolidation waves landed; cohort certification remains \| Action: CERTIFY \| Owner: Dashboard widget system \| Priority: 82/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 8**

**Work already done / code & resources:** PRs \#406/#409/#411/#413-#418 consolidated major widgets and intelligence flows. The current plan still requires size/state/mobile certification before follow-on changes. Evidence: PRs \#406/#409/#411/#413-#418; widget post-consolidation plan.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Feature consolidation is not finished until each widget works across intended sizes, states and mobile layouts.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Widget primitives; visual regression harness.

**Implementation / integration path:** Run the cohort through declared width/height states, loading/empty/error/stale/disconnected states, desktop and phone captures, and interaction tests.

**Definition of done:** All active top widgets pass the documented certification gate with no private CSS/control regressions.

### 77. WidgetRenderer extraction and registry-driven rendering

**Dashboard Architecture \| Status: Historical plan; partial registry work exists \| Action: CONSOLIDATE \| Owner: Dashboard renderer / Widget registry \| Priority: 69/100 \| Confidence: Medium \| Wave 9**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Earlier dashboard optimization work called for renderer extraction and registry-driven ownership; later consolidation reduced overlap but large render switches/helpers may remain. Evidence: Widget/dashboard optimization resource; current WidgetRenderer/registry.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** A registry-driven renderer makes widgets easier to remove, migrate, lazy-load and test.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Item 76; widget registry authority.

**Implementation / integration path:** Move remaining hard-coded rendering metadata into typed registry entries, keep lazy imports explicit, and add registry/renderer contract tests.

**Definition of done:** Adding/removing a widget requires one canonical registry change and tests catch orphaned renderer mappings.

### 78. Widget CSS ownership split and legacy override removal

**Dashboard / CSS \| Status: CSS isolation progressed; remaining shadowing paths need audit \| Action: REMOVE \| Owner: Widget CSS / Toolbox CSS \| Priority: 76/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 8**

**Work already done / code & resources:** PR \#294 isolated widget/toolbox CSS and PR \#307 removed color escape hatches, but final cleanup still calls for deleting legacy CSS that shadows canonical primitives. Evidence: PRs \#294/#307; current UI consolidation docs.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Global override debt is a recurring cause of components changing ratio, text size or color unexpectedly.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Primitive authority; item 83 legacy reference code cleanup.

**Implementation / integration path:** Audit selector reachability, move widget-specific styles next to owners, delete stale overrides after screenshots/tests.

**Definition of done:** No production primitive is restyled by unrelated legacy/widget CSS and style ownership tests stay green.

### 79. Shared Brain/dashboard selectors and narrow subscriptions

**Dashboard Performance \| Status: Some selectors exist; full convergence incomplete \| Action: CONSOLIDATE \| Owner: Dashboard data selectors \| Priority: 65/100 \| Confidence: Medium \| Wave 9**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Earlier dashboard plans called for shared Brain selectors and narrow subscriptions to reduce rerenders; Brain and widget systems have since grown substantially. Evidence: Widget/dashboard optimization resource; Brain context services.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Large global subscriptions increase rerender cost and make UI state harder to reason about.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Item 57 performance budgets; registry-driven data access.

**Implementation / integration path:** Profile current subscriptions, extract memoized domain selectors, and prohibit widgets from reading broad mutable Brain blobs when a typed projection exists.

**Definition of done:** Representative dashboard interactions meet render budgets and selectors have focused unit tests.

### 80. Persisted widget visibility/settings schema migrations

**Dashboard State \| Status: Settings/preferences exist; migration discipline must cover every consolidation \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: Dashboard storage/settings \| Priority: 72/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 9**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Workspace UX preferences landed in PR \#316 and current widget retirement/rename plans require schema-safe persisted migration. Evidence: PR \#316; BACKLOG-REGISTRY publisher/NBA migration rules.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Without versioned migration, widget renames and defaults can erase user layout/preferences.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Dashboard schema/versioned storage.

**Implementation / integration path:** Centralize migration functions, backup old layout, add fixture migrations for every ID/default change and reject duplicate instances.

**Definition of done:** All supported historic schema fixtures normalize to one current valid layout with preserved state and a recoverable backup.

### 81. Studio capability-parity certification harness expansion

**Studio \| Status: A/B component harness exists; domain parity coverage incomplete \| Action: CERTIFY \| Owner: Studio Hub / component certification \| Priority: 71/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 8**

**Work already done / code & resources:** PR \#315 added a Studio Component Library A/B certification harness; Publisher/Manager and other tools now need capability-level, not just visual, parity checks. Evidence: PR \#315; Studio primitive rollout PRs \#304/#317/#327/#338.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** A visually consistent tool can still be functionally incomplete or use the wrong backend owner.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Publisher/Manager parity items 7-8; canonical domain contracts.

**Implementation / integration path:** Extend harness metadata to include capability, backend owner, state persistence, disconnected/error behavior and mobile evidence.

**Definition of done:** Major Studio tools have a checked parity matrix and automated contract tests, not only screenshots.

### 82. Finish migration of remaining Studio controls to canonical primitives

**Studio UI \| Status: Large rollout completed; residual private/generic controls need audit \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: Studio Toolbox primitives \| Priority: 74/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 8**

**Work already done / code & resources:** PRs \#304/#305/#306/#317/#327/#338 migrated many tools and current main treats primitive authority as foundational, but residual controls should be removed systematically. Evidence: PRs \#304/#305/#306/#317/#327/#338; Studio Toolbox skill/docs.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Mixed control systems cause dropdown bugs, geometry drift and inconsistent mobile behavior.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Current primitive catalog; Toolbox UI plan \#433.

**Implementation / integration path:** Search production Studio surfaces for raw/native/private controls, replace only where equivalent primitives exist, and add behavior tests for dropdown/toggle/input state.

**Definition of done:** Production Studio contains no unauthorized generic control patterns and all custom dropdowns persist changed selections.

### 83. Legacy UStube / Reference Studio cleanup

**UI Reference \| Status: Legacy prototype/reference code remains discoverable; production role unclear \| Action: REMOVE \| Owner: Reference Studio / docs migration \| Priority: 59/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 9**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Current main searches still find \`UsTube\` defaults and \`ustube\` modules in Reference Studio, ComponentGridLab and reorganization scripts. Evidence: src/components/ui/LibrarySidebar.tsx; ComponentGridLab.tsx; src/views/referenceStudio/\*; scripts/reorganize-html-docs.mjs.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Legacy naming and prototypes can confuse agents, developers and CSS ownership even when not user-facing.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Documentation/reference authority; reachability audit.

**Implementation / integration path:** Classify each reference file as active library, donor fixture or obsolete; rename active artifacts to ViewTube and quarantine/delete unreachable legacy code.

**Definition of done:** No production-visible UStube branding remains; every retained reference module has an explicit documented purpose and owner.

### 84. Quick Switcher exact-identity continuity

**Navigation \| Status: Switcher and pins landed; deeper context continuity needs certification \| Action: CERTIFY \| Owner: Quick Switcher / ActionPacket \| Priority: 64/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 9**

**Work already done / code & resources:** PRs \#334/#336 added global quick switching and pins. Cross-tool identity now needs to be preserved consistently rather than only route navigation. Evidence: PRs \#334/#336; item 20 ActionPacket continuity.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Fast navigation is most useful when the destination opens the current video/project/contentBuild rather than a generic page.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Item 20; destination context recipes.

**Implementation / integration path:** Teach switcher entries when to send an ActionPacket/context ID bundle, preserve recent destination state, and test back/forward/rotation behavior.

**Definition of done:** Switching between major creator tools preserves applicable identity/selection and never creates a duplicate workspace context.

### 85. Application-wide responsive + accessibility certification

**UI / Mobile \| Status: Many targeted fixes landed; one complete matrix remains open \| Action: CERTIFY \| Owner: UI QA / Accessibility \| Priority: 88/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 10**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Toolbox, Settings, Editor, Vault and dashboard mobile fixes have landed in many PRs, but the finish program still calls for one responsive/state matrix. Evidence: PRs \#432/#430/#379/#376; mobile QA docs; finish-program Phase 9.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Local fixes can regress adjacent screens; a single certification matrix is needed before calling the app shippable.

**Dependencies / blockers:** All current canonical primitives/pages; visual regression harness.

**Implementation / integration path:** Define route x viewport x state coverage, keyboard/focus/touch targets, reduced motion and safe-area checks; capture built-app evidence.

**Definition of done:** Critical routes pass desktop/narrow/portrait/landscape, keyboard and touch tests with no clipping, inaccessible controls or state loss.

### 86. Canonical auth/session/channel-readiness error model

**Auth \| Status: Foundations improved; final distinction/certification remains \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: Account/Auth coordinator \| Priority: 96/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 1**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Auth/session was historically the top blocker; current main has server-owned account/auth ownership, but errors must stay distinct between session, channel readiness and feature/API authorization. Evidence: Unfinished Work Master Resource; account/auth tests; docs consolidation PR \#401.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Conflated auth errors cause sign-out loops, misleading “not connected” states and difficult support.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Canonical account coordinator; YouTube transport; diagnostics.

**Implementation / integration path:** Define typed readiness states and error codes, migrate callers, and add mobile/session-expiry regression tests.

**Definition of done:** Every major surface can distinguish logged-out, channel-unavailable, missing scope, API failure and feature-disabled without forcing unnecessary logout.

### 87. OAuth / YouTube route consolidation regression closure

**Auth / API \| Status: Many repairs landed; legacy/stale callers still require reachability audit \| Action: REMOVE \| Owner: Account/Auth / YouTube transport \| Priority: 92/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 1**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Historical failures included \`/api/auth/google/start\` 404 and \`/api/account/google-proxy\` 403/repetition; current authority says one server-owned path and one canonical YouTube transport. Evidence: Auth resources; PR \#401 docs authority; accountCoordinator/authSession tests.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Duplicate routes and stale callers are a high-risk source of mobile connection failures.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Item 86; endpoint inventory; deployment routing.

**Implementation / integration path:** Trace all auth/YouTube callers, remove aliases no longer needed, retain compatibility only where proven, and add E2E login/channel/connect tests.

**Definition of done:** Production logs/tests show no calls to retired routes and login/channel bootstrap survives reload on mobile and desktop.

### 88. Permanent production diagnostics + Copy Bug Report

**Observability \| Status: Partially built historically; needs guaranteed production presence \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: Diagnostics / Support \| Priority: 95/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 1**

**Work already done / code & resources:** The Unfinished Work Master Resource calls for permanent production diagnostics after the component repeatedly disappeared during auth/mobile failures. Evidence: ViewTube_Unfinished_Work_Master_Resource_2026-09-11; current route/build metadata utilities.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Fast diagnosis is essential in a rapidly moving app with mobile/browser/deployment-specific failures.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Correlation IDs item 89; auth/readiness states; release SHA.

**Implementation / integration path:** Keep a bounded production diagnostics surface capturing build SHA, route, viewport, recent auth/network/runtime events and a sanitized copyable support bundle.

**Definition of done:** A user can reproduce a failure and copy one privacy-safe report containing enough identifiers for logs and code version lookup.

### 89. Correlation IDs across request/tool/action pipelines **\[NEW / NECESSARY\]**

**Observability \| Status: Identified in Create State; partial trace IDs exist but app-wide standard absent \| Action: BUILD \| Owner: Observability / Herald / services \| Priority: 90/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 10**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Create State lists correlation IDs as a current priority; BrainTrace and receipts provide partial building blocks. Evidence: Create State ViewTube world model; BrainTrace PR \#393; Herald receipts PR \#424.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Cross-system failures are hard to debug when auth, sync, Brain, generation, publishing and UI actions cannot be joined.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Diagnostics item 88; request middleware; action/tool receipts.

**Implementation / integration path:** Standardize correlation/request/action IDs at boundaries, propagate through logs/receipts and surface them in support bundles.

**Definition of done:** One user action can be traced end-to-end across client, API, Brain/tool calls and external write receipts by a stable correlation chain.

### 90. External-write idempotency framework **\[NEW / NECESSARY\]**

**Reliability \| Status: Implemented in some flows; inconsistent across all consequential operations \| Action: CONSOLIDATE \| Owner: Shared transaction utilities \| Priority: 95/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 1**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Create State flags incomplete idempotency as a known issue; Publisher has resumable transaction concepts but other external writes may use ad-hoc protection. Evidence: Create State world model; Publisher recovery plan; generation/tool receipts.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Duplicate comments, uploads, updates or generation jobs can cost money and damage user trust.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Correlation IDs item 89; domain receipts; server persistence.

**Implementation / integration path:** Define shared idempotency-key/receipt patterns and adopt them in publish, comment post, metadata edits, paid generation and other external writes.

**Definition of done:** Replay tests prove repeated requests return/reconcile the original result instead of causing duplicate external effects.

### 91. Durable server authority for browser-persisted critical state **\[NEW / NECESSARY\]**

**Architecture \| Status: Browser persistence remains a known risk; migration not complete \| Action: MIGRATE \| Owner: Server data layer / domain owners \| Priority: 93/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 10**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Create State flags browser-based persistence risk; finish registry also points toward eventual durable server authority for critical workflow state. Evidence: Create State world model; finish-program expanded backlog.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** LocalStorage/browser-only state can be lost, diverge across devices or undermine recovery guarantees.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Identity model; auth; migration/versioning.

**Implementation / integration path:** Classify state by durability, migrate publish/project/contentBuild/outcome/receipt-critical data server-side, and leave only cache/preferences client-local.

**Definition of done:** Critical workflow state survives device change/reload/browser storage loss and remains channel/account scoped.

### 92. Quality budgets and zero-new-failure release gates

**Release Engineering \| Status: Some gates exist; formal budgets across changed surfaces incomplete \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: CI / Release \| Priority: 90/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 10**

**Work already done / code & resources:** PR \#311 stabilized release gates; Create State calls for quality budgets on changed surfaces and lint/release debt remains a known issue. Evidence: PR \#311; Create State world model.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Rapid PR volume makes regressions inevitable without explicit budgets and baseline-aware gates.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Test inventory; performance budgets item 57; visual certification.

**Implementation / integration path:** Define baseline-aware type/test/lint/build/visual/perf budgets, require zero new failures, and publish a concise release receipt per merge.

**Definition of done:** Every PR reports changed-surface gates and cannot worsen agreed failure/performance baselines without an explicit approved exception.

### 93. End-to-end creator loop success + failure certification

**E2E QA \| Status: Pieces are tested; one complete loop remains finish criterion \| Action: CERTIFY \| Owner: E2E test suite \| Priority: 100/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 10**

**Work already done / code & resources:** The one-goal operating system and finish program both define the real target as YouTube -\> insight -\> create -\> produce -\> approve -\> publish -\> learn -\> analytics. Evidence: VIEWTUBE_ONE_GOAL_COMPLETION_OPERATING_SYSTEM; finish program Definition of Done.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Component-level success does not prove the product works as one creator operating system.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Items 1-5, 21-26, 41-43, 58, 86-92.

**Implementation / integration path:** Build deterministic happy-path and failure-path fixtures spanning auth, data, project, generation/selection, edit/render, approval, publish, remote verify, analytics and evaluation.

**Definition of done:** CI and staging can complete one full loop and targeted failures prove recovery at each boundary without orphaned state or duplicate actions.

### 94. Staging/production deployment certification

**Deployment \| Status: Deployment exists; ownership/config/runtime verification remains recurring work \| Action: CERTIFY \| Owner: Vercel / Release \| Priority: 89/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 10**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Past conversations repeatedly hit wrong project/account, quota and preview-vs-main uncertainty; current release needs explicit environment truth. Evidence: Deployment docs; docs/production-deployment-trigger.md; historical Vercel ownership issues.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** A correct merge is not useful if the wrong project/environment is deployed or mobile receives stale assets.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Release gates item 92; diagnostics item 88.

**Implementation / integration path:** Document canonical Vercel project/team/branch mapping, verify env parity/redirects/cache behavior, and run built-app browser certification on each release candidate.

**Definition of done:** A release receipt names commit SHA, deployment URL/project/environment, green gates and desktop/mobile verification evidence.

### 95. Documentation authority lifecycle and stale-doc cleanup

**Documentation \| Status: Registry/governance landed; lifecycle enforcement still ongoing \| Action: CONSOLIDATE \| Owner: Docs registry / maintainers \| Priority: 86/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 10**

**Work already done / code & resources:** PRs \#378/#380/#381/#385/#387/#401/#421 consolidated major authority areas, yet the repo still contains historical reference docs that can be mistaken for current plans. Evidence: PRs \#378/#380/#381/#385/#387/#401/#421; docs/README.md.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Distributed documentation authority is a Create State known issue and a major agent-context hazard.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Item 96 donor ledger; current docs registry.

**Implementation / integration path:** Require status/frontmatter/authority owner/supersedes links, move history to migration/reference, and automatically flag duplicate current authorities.

**Definition of done:** Every active domain has one current authority; historical files are clearly reference-only and repository checks reject duplicate “current” plans.

### 96. PR/branch donor + supersession ledger

**Repository Governance \| Status: Many donor recoveries occurred; one canonical ledger is still needed \| Action: DOCUMENT \| Owner: Migration / Docs registry \| Priority: 81/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 10**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Recent PR history contains many intentionally unmerged donor branches and superseded PRs (#407-\>#408, \#402-\>#405, \#308-\>#310, \#328-\>#329, \#301-\>#325, \#425-\>#426/#428/#429). Evidence: Last 150 PRs; donor-harvest docs; migration/reference.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** Without a ledger, future agents repeatedly rediscover or attempt to merge stale work.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Item 95; GitHub PR metadata.

**Implementation / integration path:** Maintain one machine-readable ledger: donor PR/branch, capability harvested, replacement owner, final disposition, evidence tests and safe-to-delete flag.

**Definition of done:** Every closed-unmerged/superseded donor in the active period has an explicit disposition and no “mystery branch” is required to understand current capability ownership.

### 97. Resource Library + widget/HTML reference catalog completion

**Documentation / Resources \| Status: Substantial catalog exists; full artifact coverage incomplete \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: Resource Library / Docs \| Priority: 66/100 \| Confidence: Medium \| Wave 10**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Historical plans call for adding all widget HTML files and standalone references to the resource document; the canonical library tracks many prototypes but not necessarily every current artifact. Evidence: ViewTube resource-document conversations; widget ledger/resource library.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** A searchable reference atlas prevents valuable design/function donors from being lost or reimplemented from memory.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Docs registry item 95; legacy cleanup item 83.

**Implementation / integration path:** Inventory HTML/MD/DOCX/JSON/prototypes, assign purpose/status/owner/current-vs-donor tags, and link to current implementations where absorbed.

**Definition of done:** The catalog resolves every retained prototype/resource to a current owner or reference-only disposition and flags unindexed artifacts in CI.

### 98. Public agent-readiness surface **\[NEW / NECESSARY\]**

**Agent Readiness \| Status: Live scan is poor: 31/100, llms.txt 0; major fixes open \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: Public web / docs \| Priority: 88/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 10**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Agent Ready scan of viewtube.live found no llms.txt, missing sitemap.xml/metadata/headings, weak AGENTS.md structure and JS-dependent root content. Evidence: Agent Ready scan 2026-09-25; finish-program F16.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** AI agents cannot reliably discover, cite or understand the public product/docs even though internal agent workflows are central to ViewTube.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Public-doc allowlist; docs authority; deployment.

**Implementation / integration path:** Add llms.txt/llms-full, structured sitemap.md/xml, canonical/meta/OG/JSON-LD, markdown alternates, main/headings, and prerender/static-readable public content without exposing private app data.

**Definition of done:** A re-scan materially exceeds the 31/100 baseline, llms.txt is non-zero and all published files contain only intentionally public information.

### 99. Valid OpenAPI + well-known protocol endpoint cleanup **\[NEW / NECESSARY\]**

**Agent/API Readiness \| Status: Current endpoints return invalid bodies for several protocol probes \| Action: REPLACE \| Owner: Public API/docs surface \| Priority: 74/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 10**

**Work already done / code & resources:** Agent Ready found \`/openapi.yaml\` and several \`/.well-known/\*\` paths returning 200 with invalid/non-protocol bodies. Evidence: Agent Ready scan: OpenAPI, UCP, OAuth authorization metadata, API catalog, Web Bot Auth checks.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** False-positive protocol endpoints mislead agents and integrations more than a clean 404.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Item 98; actual public API inventory; auth/security review.

**Implementation / integration path:** Publish only valid specs for protocols ViewTube truly supports; otherwise return correct not-found behavior. Add schema validation in CI.

**Definition of done:** Every exposed protocol endpoint validates against its spec and unsupported protocols no longer return misleading 200 HTML bodies.

### 100. Agent work receipts + ADR-lite + living backlog automation **\[NEW / NECESSARY\]**

**Agent Continuity \| Status: Governance schemas/receipts landed partially; adoption and automation incomplete \| Action: FINISH \| Owner: Herald / Docs / Create State \| Priority: 83/100 \| Confidence: High \| Wave 10**

**Work already done / code & resources:** PRs \#422-#424 introduced machine-readable governance schemas, validator health and Herald claims/receipts; Create State also prioritizes agent work receipts and ADR-lite. Evidence: PRs \#422/#423/#424; Create State world model; One-Goal operating system.

**Why it matters / value vs cost of leaving unfinished:** High parallel-agent throughput needs durable “started/completed/changed/verified” records or work is duplicated and decisions are lost.

**Dependencies / blockers:** Docs authority item 95; PR donor ledger item 96; CI.

**Implementation / integration path:** Require each substantial work slice to emit a machine-readable receipt with goal, branch/PR, files, tests, evidence, decisions and next blockers; auto-update the living backlog/ADR index.

**Definition of done:** A new agent can reconstruct current state from receipts + docs without relying on chat memory, and completed items automatically close/supersede stale backlog claims.


# Expansion Idea Banks — YouTube Platform, Google AI, Creator Library, and Studio Tools

These ideas extend the 100-item audit without creating duplicate architecture. They should reuse the canonical owners already named elsewhere in this document: Publisher, Video Manager, ContentBuild, Video Package, Projects, Vault, Brain/Intelligence, Analytics Canon, Dashboard widgets, Studio Toolbox primitives, Editor/Remotion, VT-SYNC, ActionPacket/handoff, and the governed outcome/evaluation/learning loop.

**Integration rule:** distinguish direct API control from assisted handoff. YouTube Data, Analytics/Reporting and Live Streaming APIs expose substantial read/write capability, but not every YouTube Studio, Shopping, monetization or account setting is publicly writable. Google Labs/Gemini products also vary in API availability. Build direct control only where an official supported API/permission exists; otherwise use import/export, deep-link, handoff, status mirroring or creator-approved manual steps.

## 10 YouTube API + YouTube Studio Integration Features

### YT-1. Unified YouTube Studio Control Center
A single ViewTube workspace that merges supported channel, video, playlist, comment, subscription, membership, live, analytics and revenue controls behind one account-scoped command surface. It should show whether each control is **directly writable**, **read-only**, **requires YouTube Studio**, or **blocked by permissions**, so the product never implies unsupported authority.

**Best integration:** Studio Hub + Dashboard command widget + canonical OAuth/session/channel readiness model.

### YT-2. Publish, Schedule and Post-Publish Operations Console
Extend the Publisher into a full YouTube operations console for upload, title/description/tags, thumbnail, captions where supported, visibility, audience settings, scheduling, premiere/live handoff, playlist placement, remote verification, retry/recovery and post-publish metadata updates. The ApprovedPublishSnapshot should remain the immutable approval boundary.

**Best integration:** Publisher + Video Manager + ContentBuild + PublishTransaction + Asset Slots.

### YT-3. Channel Customization and Homepage Architect
Manage supported channel branding and channel sections/shelves from ViewTube, with a visual preview of how playlists, popular uploads, featured groups and channel sections will appear. Where YouTube exposes only partial customization control, ViewTube should guide the creator to the exact remaining Studio action.

**Best integration:** Studio Hub settings + Channel Profile + Playlist/Series systems.

### YT-4. Comment and Community Operations Inbox
Combine comment threads, replies, moderation state, spam/report actions where supported, creator notes, saved reply styles, suggested-video routing and audience intelligence into one triage workspace. High-volume channels should get batch filters, sentiment/theme clustering and “needs creator attention” prioritization without auto-posting unless explicitly allowed.

**Best integration:** Comment Responder + Audience Loop + Brain outcome writers + Video identity.

### YT-5. Playlist, Series and Content Architecture Manager
Create, edit, reorder and organize playlists and playlist items; connect each playlist to Projects, series strategy, end-screen routing and channel sections. Add playlist health metrics, missing-video alerts, duplicate placement detection and sequence recommendations based on actual viewer flows.

**Best integration:** Projects + Video Manager + Analytics + Channel customization.

### YT-6. Live Control Room
Create and schedule broadcasts, bind streams, monitor stream health, manage eligible live settings, operate live chat moderation, moderators/bans and supported monetization/cuepoint controls, and preserve the resulting livestream as a normal ContentBuild/video after the event.

**Best integration:** Studio Hub Live toolbox + Publisher + Analytics checkpoints + Comment/Community systems.

### YT-7. Analytics, Revenue and Membership Intelligence Center
Unify YouTube Analytics/Reporting metrics and dimensions for views, watch time, retention, traffic, devices, geography, subscribers, playlists, livestreams, estimated revenue, ad performance, Premium revenue and available membership signals. Every number should retain unit, scope, window, format and provenance so comparisons pass the canonical metric-compatibility guard.

**Best integration:** Analytics page + Channel Intelligence + Revenue widgets + VT-SYNC.

### YT-8. Subscriber, Subscription and Member Relationship Center
Separate three commonly confused concepts: channel subscriber performance, the authenticated account's own subscriptions, and channel membership data available to eligible channels. Build cohort views, churn/cancellation-reason analysis where data exists, member-perk tracking, subscriber conversion paths and relationship history without pretending that private subscriber identities are universally available.

**Best integration:** Audience Analytics + Community + Membership/Revenue + CRM-like creator notes.

### YT-9. Monetization, Shopping and Commerce Operations Hub
Combine revenue analytics, ad-performance signals, Premium revenue, Super Chat/Super Thanks-style event data where available, memberships and YouTube Shopping/merchant readiness into one commerce workspace. Shopping controls that are not exposed by a supported API should appear as synchronized status, checklist and deep-link handoffs rather than fake in-app controls.

**Best integration:** Revenue Analytics + Publisher readiness + Project launch package + external commerce connectors.

### YT-10. Content Planning Calendar with YouTube State Synchronization
One calendar for Projects, drafts, scheduled uploads, premieres, livestreams, campaign moments, community tasks and post-publish checkpoints. It should reconcile planned ViewTube dates with actual YouTube publish/live state and flag drift, missed deadlines, competing releases, missing assets and under-supported launch windows.

**Best integration:** Projects + Daily Oracle + Publisher + Live + Analytics checkpoints.

## 15 Google Labs + Gemini AI Feature Ideas

**Current capability anchors for this idea bank (September 2026):** Gemini 3.1 family and Gemini Omni, Veo 3.1, Nano Banana 2 / Nano Banana Pro, Google Flow, Flow Agent and Flow Tools, Flow Music with Lyria 3 Pro, Gemini Notebook (formerly NotebookLM), Gemini Live, Deep Research, Google AI Studio/Gemini API, and related Google creative/research systems. Availability, plan limits and developer API access must be validated per feature before implementation.

### GAI-1. Flow / Veo Scene Director inside Video Director
Turn a storyboard shot, reference frame, Asset Slot or selected Vault media into Veo scene generations, including portrait 9:16 outputs, first/last-frame continuity, ingredients/reference guidance and native audio when available. Generated clips should return as versioned assets with prompt/model/provenance metadata.

### GAI-2. Nano Banana Thumbnail and Key-Art Lab
Use Nano Banana 2/Pro for thumbnail ideation, controlled image editing, subject consistency, text-aware compositions, background replacement, visual cleanup and variant generation. It should operate on existing thumbnail assets rather than create a parallel image store.

### GAI-3. Gemini Omni Multimodal Remix Workbench
Let creators drop text, images, audio and video references into one workspace and ask for a cohesive remix plan or generated output. Use cases include transforming an existing Short into a new visual concept, creating alternate hooks from footage, or adapting long-form material into several platform-ready variants.

### GAI-4. Flow Agent Batch Creative Director
Map Flow Agent-style multi-step planning into ViewTube Projects: generate several scene variants, batch-edit a recurring visual choice, organize generated assets into collections and propose the next creative action while preserving explicit creator approval gates.

### GAI-5. Flow Tools / Creator Workflow Recipe Builder
Create reusable visual workflow recipes such as “historical map → cinematic establishing shot → 9:16 crop → title card → music cue” or “product image → three ad concepts → six hook variants.” Where Flow Tools are not directly callable, export structured recipes/prompts and re-import resulting assets.

### GAI-6. Flow Music / Lyria Soundtrack Studio
Generate project-scoped music beds, stingers, transitions and theme variations using Lyria-powered workflows, with duration, mood, tempo, intensity and edit-marker controls. Track usage rights/provenance and route approved audio directly into Editor/Vault.

### GAI-7. Gemini Notebook Creator Research Room
Create one source-grounded notebook per Project, series or channel topic containing research documents, transcripts, links, notes and prior videos. Use it to produce cited research answers, briefs, FAQs, timelines, Audio/Video Overviews and reusable evidence packets for the Brain.

### GAI-8. Gemini Deep Research Topic Intelligence
Run structured research for upcoming videos, competitors/topics, historical claims, product comparisons or audience questions, then convert the result into a ViewTube Evidence Pack with sources, confidence, freshness and explicit claims requiring human verification.

### GAI-9. Gemini Live Studio Copilot
Add an optional voice-first copilot for brainstorming, script rehearsal, live editing decisions, shot review and hands-free navigation in the Studio Hub. The copilot should control ViewTube tools through typed actions rather than directly manipulating state outside canonical owners.

### GAI-10. Google Photos / Personal Intelligence Reference Picker
With explicit opt-in, allow creators to discover relevant personal photos or visual references from connected Google context for autobiographical content, thumbnails or B-roll planning. Nothing should be imported into Vault until the creator selects it.

### GAI-11. Gemini API Model Router and Experiment Bench
Build a controlled model-testing surface that compares Gemini model/prompt/context combinations against the versioned AI regression corpus. Capture latency, cost, schema validity, groundedness, usefulness and evidence quality before promoting a model configuration into production.

### GAI-12. AI Studio Prompt-to-Tool Prototyping Bridge
Use Google AI Studio as an experimentation donor for structured-output prompts, multimodal inputs, function/tool calling and model behavior. ViewTube should import proven prompt contracts and tests—not create a permanent second prompt authority.

### GAI-13. Gemini Notebook Auto-Learning Library Builder
Turn completed Projects, postmortems, high-performing videos and verified reference docs into source-grounded creator notebooks. The system could generate a “what we learned” brief, glossary, study guide, infographic or video overview and then publish approved versions into the ViewTube Library page.

### GAI-14. Cross-Modal Brand Consistency Engine
Use Gemini reasoning plus Nano Banana/Veo/Flow references to compare thumbnails, frames, generated video and audio against the creator’s Style Fingerprint. Instead of a single vague style score, show concrete mismatches in palette, typography, subject treatment, pacing, camera language and recurring motifs.

### GAI-15. Multimodal Adaptation Factory
Take one approved long-form ContentBuild and generate a governed adaptation plan for Shorts, teaser clips, thumbnail/key-art variants, localized versions, alternate intros, social cutdowns and music treatments. Each derivative remains linked to the source ContentBuild and records which Google model/tool created it.

## 15 High-Value Creator Reference Documents for the Library Page

These should be maintained as **living, versioned reference documents** rather than static blog posts. Each document should include a last-reviewed date, official-source links, examples from the creator’s own channel where appropriate, a glossary, common misinterpretations and a short “what to do with this information” section.

### LIB-1. How YouTube Recommendations and Discovery Work
A plain-language but evidence-grounded guide to Home/Browse, Suggested/Related, Search, Shorts Feed, subscriptions, notifications and other discovery surfaces—and what creators can and cannot infer about “the algorithm.”

### LIB-2. YouTube Metrics and Dimensions Master Glossary
Definitions for views, engaged views, watch time, average view duration, average percentage viewed, impressions, CTR, unique viewers, subscribers gained/lost, revenue, RPM/CPM-style measures, traffic dimensions, geography, device, content type and other analytics fields.

### LIB-3. Shorts vs Long-Form: Different Systems, Different Signals
Explain format differences in viewer behavior, distribution, retention interpretation, packaging, session behavior, monetization, cadence, creative structure and the danger of comparing unlike metrics directly.

### LIB-4. Publishing Best Practices and Preflight Checklist
A step-by-step reference covering metadata, title, description, tags where useful, thumbnail, captions, audience settings, visibility, schedule, playlists, chapters, end screens/cards where applicable, rights checks, quality control and post-publish verification.

### LIB-5. Thumbnail and Title Packaging Handbook
A practical guide to promise, clarity, curiosity, subject hierarchy, text restraint, contrast, mobile readability, title-thumbnail complementarity, variant testing and diagnosing high-retention/low-CTR versus high-CTR/low-satisfaction patterns.

### LIB-6. Audience Retention and Watch Behavior Guide
Explain retention curves, intros, dips, spikes, average percentage viewed, duration effects, chapter/segment analysis, Shorts looping behavior and how not to overreact to small samples.

### LIB-7. Traffic Sources and Discovery Pathways
Explain Browse, Suggested/Related, Search, External, Channel pages, Shorts Feed, playlists, notifications, end screens, hashtags, sound pages, remixes and other traffic sources, including how the same video can behave differently across them.

### LIB-8. Audience, Subscribers and Returning Viewers
Explain subscriber gains/losses, new vs returning viewers, viewer loyalty, audience overlap, cohort thinking, why subscriber count is not the same as active audience, and how to interpret subscriber conversion without chasing vanity metrics.

### LIB-9. YouTube Revenue and Monetization Fundamentals
Explain estimated revenue, ad revenue, Premium revenue, monetized playbacks, CPM/RPM concepts, memberships, fan funding, shopping/commerce considerations and why revenue reports can change after initial estimates.

### LIB-10. Live Streaming Operations Handbook
Cover scheduling, stream setup, encoder/health checks, chat moderation, DVR/latency choices, live analytics, monetization considerations, failure recovery and how to repurpose the archive afterward.

### LIB-11. Playlist, Series and Channel Architecture Guide
Explain playlists as viewer journeys, series structure, channel homepage sections, sequencing, evergreen versus campaign playlists, internal routing and how playlists differ from simple folders.

### LIB-12. Comments, Community and Audience Feedback Playbook
Cover moderation, response prioritization, recurring-question mining, suggested-video replies, handling criticism, identifying content opportunities and separating anecdotal comments from statistically meaningful audience evidence.

### LIB-13. Content Planning, Experiments and Learning Loops
Teach creators how to move from idea → hypothesis → package → publish → measurement → outcome → learning, including test design, avoiding simultaneous uncontrolled changes and recording what actually changed.

### LIB-14. Copyright, Rights, Reuse and AI-Generated Media Reference
A creator-oriented reference for music, footage, images, remixes, licensing, claims/strikes, attribution, AI-generated assets, provenance and when to seek official/legal guidance rather than relying on assumptions.

### LIB-15. Reading Analytics Correctly: Scope, Windows, Missingness and Statistical Traps
Explain time-window mismatches, lifecycle windows, percentages versus counts, sparse data, delayed metrics, geography/sample limitations, invalid cross-format comparisons, correlation versus causation and why “up” or “down” does not automatically explain why.

## 15 Studio Hub, Projects and Analytics Tool Ideas

### SPA-1. Creator Mission Control
A Studio Hub command surface that shows the active Project, current ContentBuild, blockers, next action, pending approvals, publishing readiness, recent anomalies and the most important evidence-backed recommendation without becoming another Brain.

### SPA-2. Research-to-Project Builder
Turn a research brief, Gemini Notebook, URL set, transcript bundle or Brain conversation into a real Project with goals, evidence, tasks, script outline, asset slots and a ContentBuild identity in one guided flow.

### SPA-3. Packaging Laboratory
A dedicated title-thumbnail-description experimentation workspace with variant sets, evidence, rubric comparison, creator selection, historical performance context and later outcome attribution to the exact package used.

### SPA-4. Publish Flight Deck
A dense but visual final readiness tool showing VIDEO → PACKAGE → RIGHTS → METADATA → AUDIENCE → SCHEDULE → APPROVAL → PUBLISH → VERIFY. It should absorb duplicate preflight/checklist surfaces rather than add another parallel publisher.

### SPA-5. Video Lifecycle Timeline
A single chronological view of idea, research, project creation, script, generated assets, edits, render, package approval, publish, analytics checkpoints, experiments, comments, outcomes and learned corrections for one video.

### SPA-6. Project Dependency and Blocker Radar
Visualize tasks and assets that are actually preventing completion: missing thumbnail choice, unresolved research claim, render failure, auth problem, unapproved package, absent captions or incomplete rights review. Rank blockers by downstream impact.

### SPA-7. Content Experiment Manager
Create experiments around packaging, intro structure, publishing time, format or follow-up strategy; lock the hypothesis and changed variables; then join measured results back to the exact variant and ContentBuild.

### SPA-8. Retention Scene and Chapter Diagnostics
Overlay retention behavior on chapters, transcript sections, edit markers and scene boundaries so creators can see where viewer behavior changes relative to actual content structure rather than only a generic line chart.

### SPA-9. Traffic Pathway Explorer
A flow/network visualization showing how viewers arrive through Search, Browse, Suggested, playlists, external sources, Shorts Feed, channel pages and internal routing, then where they go next when evidence is available.

### SPA-10. Audience Cohort Workbench
Compare new viewers, returning viewers, subscriber conversion, geography, device, format, traffic-source and lifecycle cohorts with strict metric-compatibility rules. Save useful cohorts as reusable analytics lenses rather than permanent duplicate datasets.

### SPA-11. Revenue Opportunity Analyzer
Join content type, traffic, geography, watch behavior, ad/Premium revenue, memberships and publishing cadence to identify where revenue changes came from—while separating observed data from inferred opportunity.

### SPA-12. Series and Playlist Architect
Plan a multi-video series visually, assign Projects/ContentBuilds to episodes, define playlist order, internal routing, follow-up candidates, recurring assets and publication cadence, then sync the supported playlist structure to YouTube.

### SPA-13. Comment-to-Content Opportunity Miner
Cluster repeated viewer questions, requests and pain points across comments; connect clusters to existing videos/projects; estimate evidence strength; and create a Project or follow-up idea only after creator approval.

### SPA-14. Channel Change Journal and Outcome Map
Automatically log significant creator actions—new thumbnail, title change, publish, playlist move, live event, experiment, major editor revision—and overlay later analytics so creators can inspect correlations without pretending they prove causation.

### SPA-15. Scenario Planner
Let creators model “what if” plans such as more Shorts, fewer but larger long-form uploads, a weekly live stream, a sequel series or different publishing cadence. Use historical channel evidence to show assumptions and ranges, not fake forecasts or guaranteed outcomes.


# Implementation Waves

**Wave 1:** Publishing safety + analytics comparison foundations: items 1-4, 41, 86-87, 90.

**Wave 2:** Publisher/Manager surfaces and outcome integration: items 5-10.

**Wave 3:** Project, Asset Engine and Vault continuity: items 11-16.

**Wave 4:** Outcome/evaluation + analytics data integrity: items 17-20, 24-27, 42-54.

**Wave 5:** Brain project/opportunity context + Prompt System regression safety: items 21-23, 36-40.

**Wave 6:** Editor final render, parity and Daily Oracle intelligence: items 58-65, 73-74.

**Wave 7:** Creator-facing intelligence/learning and evidence UX: items 28-35.

**Wave 8:** Responsive, widget, Studio, Data Visual and editor certification: items 55-57, 66-67, 70-72, 75-85.

**Wave 9:** Provider/repurposing optional expansion after core loop is stable: items 68-69.

**Wave 10:** Reliability, deployment, docs governance, agent readiness and final E2E: items 88-100.

# New but Necessary Capabilities

The items explicitly marked NEW / NECESSARY are: 36, 57, 69, 89, 90, 91, 98, 99, 100. They are not treated as permission for scope creep; each is justified by a current reliability, quality, observability, durability or machine-readability gap.

**36. Versioned AI regression corpus:** Without stable cases, prompt/model/context changes can quietly regress groundedness, safety, formatting or usefulness.

**57. Large-dashboard analytics performance budgets:** High-volume channel data can make otherwise-correct dashboards unusable on mobile or older hardware.

**69. Localization, dubbing and lipsync workflow:** Localization can extend reach and repurposing while keeping outputs inside the same asset/provenance system.

**89. Correlation IDs across request/tool/action pipelines:** Cross-system failures are hard to debug when auth, sync, Brain, generation, publishing and UI actions cannot be joined.

**90. External-write idempotency framework:** Duplicate comments, uploads, updates or generation jobs can cost money and damage user trust.

**91. Durable server authority for browser-persisted critical state:** LocalStorage/browser-only state can be lost, diverge across devices or undermine recovery guarantees.

**98. Public agent-readiness surface:** AI agents cannot reliably discover, cite or understand the public product/docs even though internal agent workflows are central to ViewTube.

**99. Valid OpenAPI + well-known protocol endpoint cleanup:** False-positive protocol endpoints mislead agents and integrations more than a clean 404.

**100. Agent work receipts + ADR-lite + living backlog automation:** High parallel-agent throughput needs durable “started/completed/changed/verified” records or work is duplicated and decisions are lost.

# Documentation Consolidation / Archive Plan

Keep current authorities in docs/architecture, docs/brain, docs/analytics, docs/ui and the finish-program task registry; add machine-readable status/owner/supersedes metadata.

Move older one-off merge plans, dated system audits and donor instructions to docs/migration/reference when their capability has landed.

Mark PR \#425 Vault planning artifact superseded and link to \#426/#428/#429.

Mark \#407/#402/#308/#328-era standalone fixes as superseded by their merged replacements rather than deleting evidence immediately.

Consolidate repeated widget/Toolbox/mobile design rules into the current Toolbox UI living authority and leave only concise historical changelogs.

Index all retained standalone HTML references and prototypes in one Resource Library ledger with CURRENT / DONOR / ARCHIVE disposition.

Archive obsolete auth/deployment incident notes after their durable lessons are incorporated into the canonical auth/deployment runbooks.

Keep PR241 and PR86 donor audits as capability provenance, but link each harvested idea to its current owner so agents do not re-run whole-branch merges.

Generate a stale-doc CI report that flags more than one file claiming CURRENT authority for the same domain.

Treat docs/README.md as the navigation/authority entrypoint and avoid re-creating parallel “master plans” outside the registry.

# Closeout Rule

An item is not “done” because a plan, PR or UI exists. It is done only when its canonical owner is production-reachable, its definition of done is verified, superseded paths are retired or clearly quarantined, current docs are updated, and the evidence is recorded in the living ledger/work receipt.
