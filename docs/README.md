# ViewTube Documentation

> **DOCUMENT SYSTEM PHASE A/B — 2026-09-26:** Current global documentation authority is now machine-routed through `docs/registry.json`. Start with `docs/governance/DOCUMENTATION.md`, `docs/architecture/PRODUCT_COMPLETION_CONSTITUTION.md`, `docs/architecture/PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `docs/programs/INTEGRATED_APPLICATION.md`. Older One Goal / Master Product / Finish Program sources remain preserved in place during side-by-side migration and are explicitly registered as superseded/donor sources pending lossless Removed Archive consolidation.

This directory contains ViewTube architecture, implementation plans, migration records, product references, verification evidence, and historical artifacts.

**Start here before trusting a document title.** The repository currently contains several generations of plans and references. Wave 1 of the documentation consolidation adds an authority map without moving or deleting the existing 119-file baseline.

## Documentation control

- [Machine Documentation Registry](./registry.json) — canonical current authority metadata and supersession routing.
- [Legacy Documentation Registry](./DOCUMENTATION_REGISTRY.md) — preserved Wave 1 baseline inventory/audit source pending generated replacement.
- [Documentation Governance](./governance/DOCUMENTATION.md) — current rules for authority, metadata, supersession, lossless consolidation, Removed Archive, and document creation.

These are scoped authorities. They do not make every neighboring plan or reference obsolete automatically.

## How to use this directory

When beginning work:

1. Open the machine [registry](./registry.json); use the legacy Markdown registry only for baseline/audit history.
2. Find the owning domain and lifecycle for the relevant document.
3. Prefer a `canonical` document over a historical plan.
4. For `review` items, verify the claim against current code/tests before relying on it.
5. Update the existing authority instead of creating another "master" document unless a genuinely separate scope exists.


## Current handoff maps

- [Toolbox Promotion + Workflow Chains](./specifications/TOOLBOX_PROMOTION_AND_WORKFLOW_CHAINS.md) — subordinate specification for compact Dashboard-instrument vs Toolbox-workstation promotion, twenty promotion/consolidation candidates, forty cross-tool creator recipes, shared handoff identity, and the proposal workspace at `tasks/toolbox-workflow-convergence/`. Recipes are orchestration prior art, not automatic tasks.

- [Toolbox UI + CSS Master Handoff](./handoffs/VIEWTUBE_TOOLBOX_UI_CSS_MASTER_HANDOFF.md) — complete continuation map for Toolbox/SubToolbox geometry, CSS ownership, palette, responsive behavior, primitives, certification, governance and current visual-verification priorities. Subordinate to current code/tests and the Toolbox UI Master Resource.
- [Toolbox UI + CSS Conversation Continuation Handoff](./handoffs/VIEWTUBE_TOOLBOX_UI_CSS_CONVERSATION_HANDOFF.md) — conversation-derived continuation map preserving the September 26–27 responsive audit, 3 P1 + 4 P2 findings, PR #468/#470/#474 implementation receipts, header-allocation law, intrinsic-height contract and next certification/migration work.

## Current consolidation status

**Wave 1:** merged — registry + governance + entrypoint.

**Wave 2:** Projects / ContentBuild / Asset Engine authority consolidated. The two living masters now absorb current-state identity, persistence, generation, publishing and frontend-manifestation requirements; older implementation/backbone/convergence documents remain in place as clearly labeled history/reference.

**Wave 3:** Toolbox/Studio UI authority is reconciled to production tokens/tests; stale desktop 56/44 migration documents are clearly historical, the Component Library index is derived from its 62-family production registry, and Dashboard/Analytics responsive systems remain explicitly scoped rather than being folded into Toolbox geometry.

**Wave 4:** Analytics/VT-SYNC now has one living architecture authority. The old migration README is historical, canvas/responsive contracts are scoped canonical authorities, and implementation plans remain active only where the audited code still has real gaps.

**Wave 5:** the unified AI contract is the Brain runtime architecture authority. The AI Systems Living Master Resource is the management/orientation authority for agents working across AI systems. Eight obsolete broad audits/phase documents were harvested and re-homed under `migration/reference/brain-ai-history/`; active AI planning now routes through the living master, Finish Program, Brain-quality tasks and Prompt System Authority. Herald remains separate from creator BrainRuntime.

**Wave 6:** Simple Auth V1 is the canonical browser-session contract; Editor documentation is reconciled to the live desktop/mobile bridge; deployment/release has a script-backed living master; Guide V2 has a living authority over its derived route/dataset/tool/widget/metric/visual registries.

Wave 7 archival has now begun for the AI domain: superseded AI audits/phase documents were preserved under `migration/reference/brain-ai-history/` and removed from active authority paths only after unique-rule harvest and inbound-reference review. Other domains remain subject to the same non-destructive rules.

### Planned waves

1. Registry / governance / entrypoint — **complete**
2. Projects / ContentBuild / Asset Engine — **complete in Wave 2**
3. Studio UI / Toolbox / widgets / mobile — **complete in Wave 3**
4. Analytics / Data Visuals / migrations — **complete in Wave 4**
5. Brain / AI / Herald — **complete in Wave 5**
6. Auth / Editor / deployment / user guide — **complete in Wave 6**
7. Archive/evidence re-homing + root cleanup — **next**
8. Automated governance + broken-link certification

## Important rule

A filename containing **MASTER**, **CANONICAL**, **SOURCE OF TRUTH**, or **AUTHORITY** is not enough to establish current truth. Use the registry, the declared scope, and current repository evidence.


## Projects / ContentBuild / Asset Engine document family

Current authority is intentionally split by scope:

- [Projects / ContentBuild Workflow Master](./architecture/VIEWTUBE_PROJECTS_CONTENTBUILD_WORKFLOW_MASTER_RESOURCE.md) — creator-facing Project workflow, shared identity, system ownership and cross-system continuity.
- [Asset Engine Master Resource](./architecture/VIEWTUBE_ASSET_ENGINE_MASTER_RESOURCE.md) — assets, versions/options, generation context/receipts, selections/finalization, publishing/launch projections, provenance and evaluation linkage.

Preserved donors (historical/reference, not current authority):

- `architecture/ASSET_ENGINE_CONTENTBUILD_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_2026-09-20.md`
- `architecture/PROJECT_CONTENTBUILD_ASSET_ENGINE_VIDEO_PACKAGE_CONSOLIDATION_2026-09-22.md`
- `brain/ASSET_ENGINE_CANONICAL_BACKBONE.md`
- `architecture/VIDEO_ASSET_ENGINE_WIDGET_IDEAS_2026-09-20.md`


## UI authority boundaries

- **Toolbox/SubToolbox production system:** `architecture/VIEWTUBE_TOOLBOX_UI_MASTER_RESOURCE.md`, verified against production tokens/CSS/tests.
- **Component Library catalog + primitive corrections:** `ui/STUDIO_HUB_COMPONENT_LIBRARY_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md`.
- **Dashboard widgets:** production identity/metadata comes from `src/views/dashboard/WidgetRegistry.ts`; certification and recovery plans are scoped Dashboard documents.
- **Analytics Data Visuals:** `MOBILE_VISUAL_RESPONSIVE_CONTRACT.md` and VT-SYNC visual registries own chart/module responsive intent; they do not redefine Toolbox shell geometry.

Current shell geometry:
- desktop: Main 80 / SubToolbox 56 / L1 48 / L2 32;
- mobile shell: Main 56 / SubToolbox 44, preserving 26px / 20px title sizes.


## Analytics / VT-SYNC authority boundaries

- **Raw analytics truth:** VT-SYNC Local.
- **Visible dataset identity:** `VT_SYNC_VISIBLE_TABLE_DEFINITIONS`.
- **Normalized consumer API:** `services/analytics-canon`.
- **Window vocabulary/ranges:** `src/services/analytics/windows.ts`.
- **Living documentation authority:** `analytics/VIEWTUBE_ANALYTICS_VT_SYNC_MASTER_RESOURCE.md`.
- **Canvas geometry:** `migration/data-visual-canvas-contract.md`.
- **Phone/desktop visual composition:** `MOBILE_VISUAL_RESPONSIVE_CONTRACT.md`.
- **Active implementation programs:** dataset expansion, time-window migration, controller unification, mark-scale migration, and Master Data overlay portal.

The August `migration/README.md` remains valuable history but is no longer current-state authority.


## Brain / AI / Herald authority boundaries

- **AI systems management / agent orientation:** `brain/VIEWTUBE_AI_SYSTEMS_MASTER_RESOURCE.md`.
- **Creator-facing reasoning/orchestration:** `brain/UNIFIED_AI_SYSTEM_CANONICAL_CONSOLIDATION_CONTRACT_2026-09-17.md` plus current `src/services/brain/**`.
- **Canonical analytics evidence for Brain:** `services/analytics-canon`; Brain derives evidence quality but does not own analytics storage.
- **Outcome/evaluation/learning:** existing Brain/Algorithm outcome, evaluation and governed-learning owners; never create a second generic ledger.
- **Cross-tool handoffs:** `brain/UNIVERSAL_TOOL_HANDOFFS_AND_SUGGESTED_CHAINS.md` is a production-linked protocol reference, subordinate to domain owners.
- **Repository AI-work governance (Herald):** `agent/contracts/herald-in.md`, `herald-out.md`, `herald-workflow.md`, `.viewtube/herald/**`, and `.viewtube/exchange/**`.
- **Historical Herald design:** `VIEWTUBE_HERALD_CROSS_APP_AI_CONVERSATION_SYSTEM_PLAN_2026-09-15.md` explains the design evolution but is no longer current status authority.

BrainRuntime serves ViewTube creators. Herald governs AI agents working on the ViewTube repository. They exchange context/provenance where useful but are not one runtime.


## Editor living authority

The unified desktop/mobile editor program now has a single living integration authority:

- editor/VIEWTUBE_YOUTUBE_EDITOR_SYSTEM_MASTER_RESOURCE.md
- editor/EDITOR_BRAIN_HUB_ASSISTANT_PLAN.md

Every editor-related agent/conversation must update the master resource Current Work and append-only Update Log before handoff. Specialized editor/Brain/Asset/Toolbox documents remain authoritative for their bounded concerns as declared by DOCUMENTATION_REGISTRY.md.


## Auth / Editor / Deployment / Guide boundaries

- **Auth:** `architecture/SIMPLE_AUTH_V1.md`; flat `/api/auth-*` routes are the browser contract, nested routes are compatibility aliases through the same server router.
- **YouTube API migration:** `architecture/YOUTUBE_API_STABILIZATION_V1_TRACKER.md` remains active until typed-route parity and legacy deletion finish.
- **Editor:** `editor/VIEWTUBE_YOUTUBE_EDITOR_SYSTEM_MASTER_RESOURCE.md`; VT_E1 and mobile share the versioned project bridge, with remaining work focused on parity/certification rather than first bridge wiring.
- **Deployment/release:** `deployment/VIEWTUBE_DEPLOYMENT_RELEASE_MASTER_RESOURCE.md`; live production truth is the exact commit reported by `/api/release`, not repository state alone.
- **User Guide V2:** `user-guide-v2/VIEWTUBE_USER_GUIDE_V2_MASTER_RESOURCE.md`; product inventories derive from canonical registries instead of being copied into prose.


## AI historical archive

Superseded broad AI audits, phase manifests and phase-closeout records are preserved under `migration/reference/brain-ai-history/`. They are provenance only; current status comes from the AI Systems Living Master Resource, bounded canonical authorities, current code/tests, and the Finish Program.


## Cross-system Master Tool architecture

- [Master Product, Tools & Workstation Architecture](./architecture/VIEWTUBE_MASTER_PRODUCT_TOOLS_WORKSTATION_ARCHITECTURE.md) owns the cross-system creator lifecycle, 12-Master-Tool taxonomy, consolidation map, integration planning vocabulary and code-awareness crosswalk.
- It coordinates but does **not** replace Analytics/VT-SYNC, BrainRuntime, Projects/ContentBuild, Asset Engine, Toolbox UI, Widget Registry, Editor, Auth, Deployment or Herald authorities.
- Future tool/widget ideas should be assigned to a Master Tool here before creating a new page, store, registry or runtime.

## Cross-system convergence and consolidation

Before broad new AI/Brain/Project/Asset integration work, use [System Convergence & Consolidation](./architecture/VIEWTUBE_SYSTEM_CONVERGENCE_AND_CONSOLIDATION.md).

It coordinates overlap reduction across Creator Context, Evidence & Intelligence, Project/Content/Asset identity, Creator Operations, Outcomes/Learning and BrainRuntime. It does not replace the bounded authorities above. Its rule is **converge before expansion**: donor-harvest useful behavior, migrate callers through stronger canonical contracts, prove parity/zero reachability, quarantine, then remove.


## Master Sources

Master Sources are exceptional high-value references that must be consulted as prior art within their declared scope but do not override current authorities or verified implementation evidence.

- [Deep Research & Construction Source](./references/DEEP_RESEARCH_CONSTRUCTION_SOURCE.md) — MASTER_SOURCE for product/tool ideation, master-tool consolidation, source/claim auditing, API feasibility, Channel Brain/agent architecture, analytics/visualization, creator workflow, external integrations, infrastructure/economics/governance, and roadmap construction.
