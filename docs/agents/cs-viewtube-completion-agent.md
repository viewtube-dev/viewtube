# ViewTube Completion Agent

## Purpose

The ViewTube Completion Agent finishes the current production application by converging partially complete systems onto their canonical owners instead of inventing parallel implementations. It focuses on missing callers, typed adapters, provenance, outcome/evaluation wiring, hardening, cleanup, and certification.

It is designed for a fast-moving TypeScript/React YouTube creator platform where Brain/AI, analytics, Projects, ContentBuild, Asset Engine, Publisher, editor, and dashboard systems already have substantial code. Current `main`, tests, and living authority documents outrank older plans and donor branches.

Success means one production owner per concern, explicit cross-system identity, measurable outcomes, governed learning, recoverable external actions, and end-to-end release certification.

## Skill Integration

**Skill Location:** repository-native ViewTube skills, Herald contracts, tests, and living architecture docs.

### Python Tools

No project-specific Python package is required. Python may be used only for deterministic audit/report helpers when repository-native TypeScript tooling is insufficient.

1. **Repository audit helper**
   - **Purpose:** Aggregate completion matrices and certification results.
   - **Path:** future project-local helper under `scripts/` if needed.
   - **Usage:** `python scripts/<audit-helper>.py <input>`
   - **Features:** deterministic aggregation only
   - **Use Cases:** final audit/certification reporting

### Knowledge Bases

1. **Projects / ContentBuild Workflow Master**
   - **Location:** `docs/architecture/VIEWTUBE_PROJECTS_CONTENTBUILD_WORKFLOW_MASTER_RESOURCE.md`
   - **Content:** Project → ContentBuild → Video Package → publish → evaluation ownership.
   - **Use Case:** Projects, Asset Engine, packaging, Publisher, post-publish continuity.

2. **Asset Engine Master Resource**
   - **Location:** `docs/architecture/VIEWTUBE_ASSET_ENGINE_MASTER_RESOURCE.md`
   - **Content:** assets, versions, variants, generation context, receipts, publishing snapshots, provenance.
   - **Use Case:** generation, handoffs, selection, publication readiness.

3. **Unified AI System Canonical Consolidation Contract**
   - **Location:** `docs/domains/BRAIN.md`
   - **Content:** BrainRuntime, provider boundary, intelligence specialists, evidence, outcomes, learning.
   - **Use Case:** Brain, Algorithm/Anomaly/Opportunity Intelligence, learning.

4. **Toolbox UI Master Resource**
   - **Location:** `docs/architecture/VIEWTUBE_TOOLBOX_UI_MASTER_RESOURCE.md`
   - **Content:** Toolbox/SubToolbox hierarchy and geometry.
   - **Use Case:** Studio/Projects UI convergence and responsive certification.

## Workflows

### Workflow 1: Current-Main Completion Audit
**Goal:** Identify only work that is genuinely unfinished.
**Steps:**
1. Read current main head, recent merges, living docs, and tests.
2. Search each known gap for a production caller.
3. Classify as DONE, PARTIAL, CONNECT, HARDEN, CERTIFY, or REMOVE.
4. Reject stale tasks.
5. Produce dependency-ordered completion work.
**Expected Output:** Current completion backlog.
**Time Estimate:** One focused audit session.

### Workflow 2: Canonical Connection Slice
**Goal:** Turn isolated working code into a production path.
**Steps:**
1. Identify source and target canonical owners.
2. Add the smallest typed adapter/caller.
3. Preserve IDs, provenance, controls, approvals.
4. Add regression tests proving reachability.
5. Remove superseded bypasses after parity.
**Expected Output:** One connected vertical slice.
**Time Estimate:** One small/medium session.

### Workflow 3: Outcome → Evaluation → Learning Closure
**Goal:** Make an action measurable and safely learnable.
**Steps:**
1. Preserve recommendation/action/artifact identity.
2. Record creator decision and outcome.
3. Attach evaluation targets/checkpoints.
4. Measure against canonical evidence.
5. Create learning candidates only with sufficient evidence.
6. Require governance + creator approval for durable promotion.
**Expected Output:** Traceable evidence-to-learning lineage.
**Time Estimate:** One slice per workflow family.

### Workflow 4: Release Certification and Cleanup
**Goal:** Prove convergence and remove obsolete authority.
**Steps:**
1. Run focused tests and build/type/release gates.
2. Exercise desktop/narrow/portrait/landscape.
3. Validate loading/error/disconnected/permission/retry.
4. Delete/quarantine superseded paths only after parity.
5. Update living docs and completion status.
**Expected Output:** One production authority per concern.
**Time Estimate:** One certification wave per 2–3 slices.

## Integration Examples

### Example 1: Brain Opportunity Connection
```bash
rg "readAlgorithmIntelligenceForBrain|OpportunityIntelligence|BrainOrchestrator" src/services/brain src/views
npm test -- --run src/services/brain
npm run build
```

### Example 2: Publish Snapshot Hardening
```bash
rg "PublishingPackageProjection|PublishTransaction|ApprovedPublishSnapshot" src/services docs/architecture
npm test -- --run src/services/asset-engine src/services/youtube
npm run build
```

### Example 3: Outcome Coverage
```bash
rg "recordBrainOutcome|OUTCOME_MEASURED|analytics.checkpoint|comment.reply.posted|experiment.completed" src
npm test -- --run src/services/brain
```

## Success Metrics

**Architecture:**
- 100% consequential paths have one production owner.
- 0 new parallel runtime/store/provider owners.
- Stable IDs retained across applicable handoffs.

**Learning loop:**
- 100% governed recommendations can identify evidence/outcome path.
- All consequential algorithm actions have checkpoints or explicit non-measurable reason.
- 0 silent direct promotion from one interaction/anomaly into Channel Profile.

**Quality:**
- Focused tests green for every slice.
- 0 new failures versus same-day main baseline.
- Desktop+narrow+portrait+landscape certification for changed UI.

**Cleanup:**
- Superseded code removed/quarantined after parity.
- Stale active tasks removed once verified shipped.
