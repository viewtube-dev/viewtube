The replacement PR must target `main` from
`integration/advanced-superset-2026-08-22`. PR #11 may be closed as superseded
only after its head remains an ancestor of the replacement PR head and the
feature-contract gates pass.

The rollback-style patch is quarantined evidence. None of its seven reversions
may be applied to the release branch.

## Required behavior evidence

- Account identity, session, refresh tokens, channel selection, billing, and
  reconnect behavior remain server-owned.
- Google proxy errors distinguish retryable, reconnect-required, and ordinary
  unauthenticated states without converting the latter into server outage.
- Sync retries are bounded and API/snapshot VT-SYNC rows cannot be removed by
  supplemental imports.
- Orientation anchoring, comment access ownership, route/build diagnostics,
  deferred visuals, custom Tube Explorer art, and three deterministic hero
  variants remain present.
- `insightDark` owns the shared dark context-bar convention for dark-canvas
  modules; individual modules do not duplicate that style contract.
- Format Dominance and Heat Matrix each have exactly one `HeroIntroBoundary`
  replay owner and no component-local replay event listener.

## Release invariants

- `main` is never pushed directly or force-updated.
- A Vite build is not sufficient evidence without typecheck, lint, focused
  contracts, full tests, governance, and smoke checks.
- The tested local SHA, pushed branch SHA, Vercel preview SHA, PR head SHA, and
  eventual production SHA must match at their respective gates.
- The auth and quick-wins worktrees and branches remain available until a
  production release is verified and their removal is separately approved.

## Local gate checkpoint

At code checkpoint `7030a02882a2045b6eef0eb66da52b3f12d8c874`:

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Focused contracts | Pass: 12 files, 48 tests |
| Full Vitest suite | Pass: 117 files, 680 tests |
| Node release metadata tests | Pass: 2 tests |
| Node account tests | Pass: 13 tests |
| TypeScript | Pass: zero errors |
| Source governance | Pass: routes, CSS, quarantine, source tree, privacy |
| Production build | Pass |
| Local smoke | Pass on API `:3000` and Vite `:5173` |
| Canonical runtime lint | **Blocked:** 1,835 errors and 90 warnings across 222 files |
| Authenticated visual acceptance | **Pending:** no authenticated fixture/session was available |

The branch must not be pushed as a release candidate and the replacement PR
must not be opened until canonical runtime lint reaches zero and authenticated
acceptance is completed. Production, PR #11, GitHub protection, branch cleanup,
and Vercel project configuration remain unchanged at this checkpoint.
