# VIEWTUBE SKILL FINDER

1. Search `.claude/skills`, current architecture docs, and the target code owners.
2. Rank candidate skills by trigger match, canonical ownership, evidence access, and verification fit.
3. Prefer one lead skill plus one reviewer; avoid loading every skill.
4. If no current skill fits, return a gap statement with the exact missing responsibility and recommend a new skill boundary.
5. Output: lead skill, supporting skill(s), evidence to read, files/owners, handoff path, and why alternatives were rejected.
