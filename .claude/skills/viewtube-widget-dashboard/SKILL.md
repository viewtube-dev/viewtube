description: Build, redesign, register, lay out, audit, and optimize ViewTube dashboard widgets using the canonical WidgetShell, widget primitives, Toolbox CSS system, responsive size contracts, data states, and performance guardrails. Use for dashboard widget work; do not use for unrelated page-level tools or generic React components.

# ViewTube Widget Dashboard

Treat the repository as the source of truth. Preserve working behavior while reducing duplicate rendering, CSS, data access, and registry paths.

## Start Here

1. Inspect the current branch and working tree; preserve unrelated edits.
2. Read the relevant canonical files:
   - `src/views/dashboard/WidgetRegistry.ts`
   - `src/views/dashboard/WidgetRenderer.tsx`
   - `src/views/dashboard/WidgetShell.tsx`
   - `src/views/dashboard/WidgetPrimitives.tsx`
   - `src/views/dashboard/WidgetPrimitiveExtensions.tsx`
   - `src/views/dashboard/types.ts`
   - `src/views/dashboard/tokens.ts`
   - `src/views/dashboard/toolboxWidgetSystem.css`
3. For architectural optimization, migration, performance auditing, or code removal, read [references/architecture-baseline.md](references/architecture-baseline.md).
4. For creating, redesigning, resizing, or certifying a widget, read [references/widget-build-contract.md](references/widget-build-contract.md).
5. For the grid, size/height buckets, container queries, adding a widget module, or CSS layer placement, read [references/grid-layout-and-modules.md](references/grid-layout-and-modules.md).
6. Before writing any markup or CSS inside a widget, read [references/primitive-catalog.md](references/primitive-catalog.md) and reuse what already exists.
7. For the current measured state of the system and the phased optimization sequence, read `docs/architecture/VIEWTUBE_WIDGET_DASHBOARD_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md`.

## Choose the Work Mode

### Create or redesign one widget

- Start from the user task and information priority, not a visual mock alone.
- Reuse `WidgetShell` and primitives before adding markup or CSS.
- Give the widget one registry definition, one renderer key, and one implementation.
- Support every declared size/height combination using container responsiveness.
- Model loading, ready, empty, blocked, stale, and error states when the widget reads data.
- Keep expensive libraries, API calls, and context subscriptions inside the lazy widget boundary.
- Register and certify the widget only after its states and dimensions work.

### Design a dashboard layout or grid

- Keep the shell's 24-column grid and size bucket vocabulary unless a measured failure justifies migration.
- Select size from information density and primary action needs:
  - `quarter`/`companion`: one KPI, status, or short action.
  - `third`/`between`: compact workflows or small comparisons.
  - `half`: standard charts, lists, and multi-step tools.
  - `two-thirds`/`three-quarters`: dense analysis or editing.
  - `full`: tables, timelines, relationship graphs, or multi-panel workspaces.
- Pair size with a declared height bucket. Do not use ad hoc fixed heights inside a widget.
- Use shell media queries only for page-level navigation/grid behavior. Use container queries for widget internals.
- Test narrow mobile, quarter, half, and full-width placements independently.

### Optimize, merge, simplify, or remove code

- Measure before changing: route chunks, CSS output, render counts, DOM nodes for large lists, and interaction timing.
- Prefer extraction and deletion over adding a second abstraction.
- Preserve public widget IDs and normalize stored layouts through a schema migration when IDs or dimensions change.
- Consolidate duplicate CSS by layer: tokens, shell, primitives, archetypes, widget-specific rules, accessibility.
- Split inline widget implementations out of `WidgetRenderer.tsx`; keep it a typed lazy resolver and fallback boundary.
- Virtualize only genuinely large or unbounded tables/galleries. Do not add a virtualization dependency to ordinary widget grids.
- Do not introduce Module Federation or another micro-frontend runtime without an independently deployable-widget requirement and measured benefit.
- Remove legacy code only after import, registry, persisted-layout, and user-guide consumers are accounted for.

## Non-Negotiable ViewTube UI Contract

- Colored header and left icon rail meet the outer edge; no third strip.
- Black icon strokes; title/button/label text is heavy and legible.
- Outer spacing follows tokens: 24px grid gap/padding, 12px internal gap, 8px dense gap.
- Border hierarchy: 4px shell, 3px module, 2px control; radii 16/12/8px.
- Shadow color derives from the widget title color at controlled opacity.
- Inputs use the icon-rail/title color for focus indication.
- Media uses explicit `aspect-ratio` (16/9, 9/16, or the declared asset ratio).
- Overflow belongs in an explicit `WidgetScrollArea`; headers and titles do not scroll.
- Data visuals include text labels or patterns; color is never the sole carrier of meaning.

## Verification and Handoff

Run the narrowest relevant checks, then the dashboard contract suite and production build for structural work:

~~~bash
npx vitest run src/views/dashboard/__tests__ src/views/dashboard/useDashboardData.vtSync.test.ts
npm run build
~~~

The dashboard contract suite is 7 files / 50 tests and must stay at 50/50.

Also verify:

- registry IDs and renderer keys are unique and covered;
- all ready widgets are revealable and persisted layouts normalize correctly;
- no widget crashes the dashboard because `WidgetErrorBoundary` and lazy fallback remain intact;
- keyboard labels, focus visibility, reduced motion, blocked/error recovery, and mobile overflow work;
- before/after bundle and CSS figures are recorded for performance changes.

Report changed files, tests, measured impact, remaining risks, and any migration/rollback requirement.
