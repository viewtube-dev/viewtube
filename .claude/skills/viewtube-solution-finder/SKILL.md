# VIEWTUBE SOLUTION FINDER

Use for architecture, debugging and consolidation questions where several implementation paths are plausible.

## Method
1. Define the observable problem and success condition.
2. Inspect current main owners, recent migration references, existing skills and tests.
3. Generate at least three solution classes: reuse/repair, consolidate/migrate, and new implementation.
4. Compare them by scope, reversibility, ownership fit, migration cost, runtime risk and verification cost.
5. Prefer the smallest solution that satisfies acceptance without duplicating ownership.
6. Return a recommended path, rejected alternatives, exact owners/files to inspect, and the verification plan.

Do not optimize for novelty. Optimize for ViewTube coherence and preserved working behavior.
