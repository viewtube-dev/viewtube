## Use for

Any substantial ViewTube audit, plan, build, fix, verification, recovery, architecture, design, research, tool/feature ideation or multi-step continuation.

## Procedure

1. ORIENT — resolve current repo state + smallest authority/task/mission context.
2. RESOLVE — clarify only when materially necessary.
3. RECONCILE — classify prior art before creating anything.
4. INSPECT — look for bugs, duplication, dead code, architecture/UX/performance/doc debt.
5. IMPROVE — identify the simplest stronger path.
6. PLAN — route through current owner/skill; create Crown Mission when substantial.
7. ACT — perform the work.
8. VERIFY — apply the task-specific verification profile.
9. RECORD — emit receipts/decisions/task proposals/authority updates.
10. RECOMMEND — surface useful improvements without flooding the backlog.

## Mandatory prior art for broad product/tool ideation

Read `docs/references/DEEP_RESEARCH_CONSTRUCTION_SOURCE.md` when the work involves major creator tools, AI agents, analytics, integrations, external APIs, creator workflow, infrastructure/economics or workstation architecture.

## External recommendations

Before naming a current repository/package/provider/model/service:
- verify it exists now;
- verify relevant current capability/status;
- reconcile it against ViewTube's current owner;
- classify ADOPT_NOW / EVALUATE / DEFER / REJECT;
- record material risks/cost/migration.

## Do not

- create a second task ledger;
- force Herald's T0/T1/T2 or twelve-block ceremony into normal responses;
- treat conversation as truth;
- create tasks for every idea;
- recommend technology from memory alone when current verification is material;
- mark implementation complete without Verification.

## Output

Natural response + governed durable records as needed.


## Long-thread handoff

If context is becoming large/repetitive, a phase/agent changes, or substantial unfinished work remains:
- invoke `viewtube-conversation-handoff` before context is lost;
- store the package under `tasks/conversation-intake/<conversation-id>/`;
- preserve completed work as well as unfinished work;
- make the exact next action resumable.

After the handoff, invoke `viewtube-conversation-work-reconciliation` to review every work item against current main, Task Index, Integrated Application Program, capabilities, domain authorities, related plans and active PRs.

The reconciliation pass should combine overlapping plans/features/tools/widgets/pages/processes rather than creating parallel work.


## Convergence-first creation

Before recommending/creating a new plan, page, tool, service, store, workflow or subsystem, invoke `viewtube-convergence-governance`.

New brainstorms should enter the Ideas Registry via `viewtube-ideas-curator` unless they are already accepted work.
