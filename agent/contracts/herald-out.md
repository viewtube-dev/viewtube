> **MIGRATION NOTICE — 2026-09-26:** This source is superseded by `docs/governance/CONVERSATION_OS.md` and `agent/contracts/conversation-os.md`. It remains intact below as donor/provenance material pending lossless Removed Archive consolidation. Do not treat it as current authority.

# HERALD-OUT — the ViewTube response contract

**Status:** canonical source. Mirrored copies live in `AGENTS.md`, `.claude/skills/`,
`.codex/skills/`, `.cursor/rules/`, `GEMINI.md`. The planned distributor
`scripts/herald-sync.mjs` is **not implemented on current main**. Edit **this** canonical
file first, then update affected mirrors manually until the distributor exists. Do not instruct
agents to run a nonexistent sync command.

Applies to every AI conversation about ViewTube, in every application.

## 1. Pick the tier first

Mechanical, not discretionary:

| Tier | When | Blocks required |
|---|---|---|
| **T0** | No `src/` change, ≤1 file, reversible in one command | 1, 9, 10 |
| **T1** | *Default.* Any `src/`/`server/`/`api/` change, or any new file | 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11 |
| **T2** | Crosses ≥2 canonical owners · adds a subsystem · changes a schema or contract · touches auth, billing, publishing or OAuth | all 12 |

When torn between two tiers, take the higher one. A T2 response to a T0 ask is waste;
a T0 response to a T2 ask is how production breaks.

---

## 2. The twelve blocks

### §1 READBACK — always
```
INTENT     one sentence, outcome not method
ASSUMING   what I am assuming unless corrected
NOT DOING  what I am deliberately leaving alone
TIER       T0 | T1 | T2      VERB  AUDIT|RECON|PLAN|BUILD|FIX|VERIFY|DOCUMENT|DECIDE|RECOVER
```

### §2 PRIOR-ART — T1, T2
Has this already been built? State what was searched and the verdict:
`NOVEL` · `PARTIAL (n prior attempts)` · `EXISTS (<ref>)` · `FAILED-BEFORE (<ref>)`

Search order: Task Index (1,598 tasks) → `.viewtube/herald/recon/` cache → `docs/` →
`_quarantine/` → `governance/` → `.viewtube/exchange/` → branches via `git ls-remote`
(**never** local refs — the agent clone is shallow) → closed PRs.

`EXISTS` and `FAILED-BEFORE` stop the work. Report and ask; do not rebuild.

### §3 OWNER — T1, T2
Name the canonical owner of every path you will touch. `docs/migration/reference/VIEWTUBE_SYSTEM_REGISTRY_2026-09-03.json`
lists 28 systems with owner, status, dependencies and integration rule — start there. If two owners appear, it is T2.
If you cannot name an owner, stop and ask — do not guess.

### §4 BETTER-PATH — T2
The simpler route you considered and why it loses. If the simpler route wins, say so and
take it.

### §5 OBSTACLES — T1, T2
Verified blockers only, each with the command that proved it. Always check:
- `.gitignore` is deny-by-default — will this new file be silently dropped? (`git check-ignore -v <path>`)
- Is the writer lock for these paths free?
- Is `lint:runtime` debt going to mask a real failure?

### §6 LEVERAGE-IN — what we already have — T1, T2

Before writing anything, check **all eight capability surfaces**. Consult
`agent/registry/capabilities.md` first — it is the on-file inventory and is far cheaper
than rediscovering it.

| Surface | Where | Ask |
|---|---|---|
| **Skills** | `.claude/skills/` (19), `skills-lock.json` (60 external), built-ins | does a skill already own this? |
| **Sub-agents** | `Explore`, `Plan`, `general-purpose`, `claude-code-guide` | should this fan out instead of running inline? |
| **Slash commands** | `.claude/commands/` | is this a repeatable ritual worth a command? |
| **Hooks** | `.claude/settings.json` | should this be enforced rather than remembered? |
| **MCP servers** | github · Neon · Vercel · Replit · Google Drive · vidIQ · Claude Code Remote · Claude Docs | is there a tool for this already connected? |
| **Scripts** | `scripts/` (28) | has someone automated this? |
| **npm tasks** | `package.json` (38) | ⚠️ two entries point at missing files — verify before trusting |
| **CI workflows** | `.github/workflows/` (4) | does a gate already cover this? |

Name what you will reuse. If you are writing something new, say in one line why nothing
above fits — that sentence is what stops the twentieth near-duplicate skill.

### §7 REFERENCES — what to read — T1, T2

Name the documents, artifacts, standalone HTML files and folder sets that inform this work.
Check `agent/registry/references.md` first.

**Classify every reference by authority.** This is the whole point of the block:

| Class | Means | Proves |
|---|---|---|
| **canonical** | current owner doc, schema, registry | how it is supposed to work |
| **prototype** | workbench / TSX / standalone HTML | an idea was explored — **nothing about runtime** |
| **demo** | presentation artifact | what was shown, not what ships |
| **recovery** | preservation pack, patch, snapshot | what existed before |
| **quarantined** | `_quarantine/**` | what was removed, and often *why it failed* |
| **superseded** | dated doc a newer one replaced | history; do not plan from it |

*Never treat prototype or demo behaviour as canonical runtime behaviour.* A matching
filename proves nothing. State what each reference does **not** establish.

Cite the exact path and a one-line reason. Link; never paste the contents into the
conversation — a reference the reader must be told about in full is a reference you have
turned into context bloat.

Where the reference is a folder set (`governance/canonical-code-pack/`,
`docs/migration/reference/`, `_quarantine/performance-workflow/`), name the folder and its
entry point (`README_FIRST.md`, `MANIFEST.md`) rather than listing files.

**Quarantine is a first-class source.** "We tried that and quarantined it" is a real and
frequent answer, and it is faster than rediscovering the failure.

**Missing references go on file.** If you needed something that was not indexed, append it
to `agent/registry/references.md` with its class. If you could not find something that
should exist, record the gap there too.

### §8 LEVERAGE-OUT — what we should add — T2

Recommend capabilities worth adopting, across the same taxonomy — not just repositories:

- **a skill** (repo-local, or from `skills-lock.json` sources)
- **a sub-agent** for work that should fan out or run isolated
- **a slash command** for a ritual you have now performed twice
- **a hook** for a rule that keeps being forgotten
- **an MCP server** for a system being driven by hand
- **a plugin** bundling several of the above
- **an external repository** or package
- **a CI workflow** for a check being run manually

Each recommendation carries: what it gives this specific task · fit (**adopt now** /
evaluate / defer) · caution · verification status and date.

**Never recommend from memory alone.** Verify the thing exists before naming it; a wrong
repo name costs more trust than an omitted recommendation.

**Recommendations go on file.** Append every one to `agent/registry/candidates.md` with its
date, the thread that raised it, and its fit verdict. A recommendation made only in chat is
made again next month and adopted neither time — the same failure mode as the empty cache.
Before recommending, read that file: if it is already listed, cite the existing entry and
either advance its verdict or leave it alone.

### §9 PLAN — always
Ordered steps with exact paths, exact commands, and the tests that will prove it.
No prose where a command will do.

### §10 STATUS — always
```
STATUS    complete | partial | blocked
PROVEN    <what a command actually demonstrated — include the command>
CLAIMED   <what I believe but did not run>
UNKNOWN   <what stays unverified, and why>
CHANGED   <paths>
VISUAL    <file> · <route> · <viewport> · <branch@sha> · live|fixture · auth|anon
```
Never merge PROVEN, CLAIMED and UNKNOWN. *Plans are not code; code is not integration;
integration is not verified runtime; preview is not production.*

#### VISUAL — show the change, don't describe it

**Required whenever the diff touches** `src/components/**` · `src/views/**` ·
`src/features/**` UI · any `.css` · widget, toolbox, dashboard or chart files · user-visible
copy. Attach the image in the reply; on a PR, post it to the PR.

**Not required** for `server/`, `api/`, `scripts/`, types, tests or docs — a screenshot of
unchanged UI is noise.

| Change | Minimum |
|---|---|
| Any visible change | desktop **1440×1000** |
| Mobile geometry, responsive, widget height/width | **plus** phone **390×844** — non-negotiable |
| Modifying existing UI | **before/after pair**, same route and viewport |
| Chart or data visual | include the empty, loading and error states |

**A screenshot only counts as evidence (ladder level 1) when it is the built app.**
State route, viewport, branch@sha, auth state, and whether data is live or fixture.

These do **not** count, and must be labelled per §7 REFERENCES:
- a standalone HTML prototype or demo — class `prototype`/`demo`, proves nothing about runtime
- a capture that hit an auth wall, a 404, or an error boundary
- a design mock or a hand-drawn layout
- a desktop shot standing in for a mobile claim

Capture with `scripts/capture-phase5-built-ui.mjs` (Playwright; already handles Vercel auth
walls, records `manifest.json`, exits non-zero when nothing rendered), or against the
branch's Vercel preview URL. Images land in `artifacts/` — which is gitignored, so deliver
them in the reply or the PR and keep the JSON manifest with the receipt.

**If you changed UI and did not capture it, say so in UNKNOWN.** "Looks right" is not
evidence, and a UI change with no visual is `partial`, never `complete`.

### §11 KNOW — T1, T2
Useful things the user did not ask about. Omit the block rather than pad it.

### §12 LEDGER — T2
Thread id, related prior turns, task ids touched.

## 3. Evidence ladder

Adopted verbatim from the Task Index `sourcePriority`. Do not invent another.

| Level | Source | Counts as |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | runtime / test | **PROVEN** |
| 2 | canonical main code | **PROVEN** |
| 3 | git history | **PROVEN** |
| 4 | explicit user correction | CLAIMED |
| 5 | Task Index | CLAIMED |
| 6 | active branch | CLAIMED |
| 7 | artifact | CLAIMED |
| 8 | conversation | UNKNOWN |
| 9 | memory / inference | UNKNOWN |

**A task may not be proposed `Finished` on CLAIMED evidence.** Use `Nearly Finished`.

---

## 4. Hard rules

1. **Never write task status.** Propose; the Task Authority disposes. There is one ledger.
2. **One writer per path.** Acquire the lock or wait.
3. **Deterministic before model.** If a script answers it, run the script.
4. **Cite, don't restate.** Link the doc; never paste it into the conversation.
5. **Just-in-time context.** `sed -n` a range; do not dump a file. No raw analytics in prompts.
6. **Missing ≠ zero. Synthetic ≠ live.** Preserve provenance, channel, window, grain.
7. **Never broaden** OAuth scope, billing authority, publishing rights or external writes
   because it makes implementation easier.
8. **End every turn by writing the ledger line.** A turn that wrote no ledger line did not
   happen.

9. **Editor work updates the editor living authority.** Any plan, audit, build, fix, verify or
   documentation pass that touches the desktop/mobile editor, Remotion, editor AI/generation,
   Video Director integration, captions, templates/design library, editor project state, or
   editor-related widgets must read
   docs/editor/VIEWTUBE_YOUTUBE_EDITOR_SYSTEM_MASTER_RESOURCE.md and append its Update Log
   before handoff. Register new plans, skills, standalone HTML/prototypes, donor branches and
   important sources there as well.
