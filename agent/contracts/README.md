## Distribution

**Current distribution state:** manual. The diagram below is the planned H1 distributor; `scripts/herald-sync.mjs` is not implemented on current main.


```

                                                         .codex/skills/
                                                         .cursor/rules/

`herald-sync.mjs --check` is the planned drift gate. It is not built yet (phase H1) — until it is,
the generated copies will drift, exactly as `.codex/` already has (103 and 115 diff lines).

## Rationale

Full plan, findings and phasing:
`docs/VIEWTUBE_HERALD_CROSS_APP_AI_CONVERSATION_SYSTEM_PLAN_2026-09-15.md`

## Note on tracking

`.gitignore` is deny-by-default (`/*` at line 2). These files required `git add -f`.
Until phase H0 adds `!/agent/` and `!/agent/**` to the allow-list, **every new file here
will be silently untracked**. Verify with `git check-ignore -v <path>` before assuming a
commit captured your work.
