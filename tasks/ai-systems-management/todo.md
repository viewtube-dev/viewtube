# ViewTube AI Systems Management — To Do

## Authority / documentation
- [x] Finish AI historical archive link audit.
- [x] Register living master and supporting references everywhere agents orient.
- [x] Add stable document authority/freshness rules to AI Governor references.
- [x] Confirm no old AI audit/phase doc is still presented as current.

## Skill structure
- [x] Create `references/ai-systems-management.md`.
- [x] Create `references/work-claims-and-receipts.md`.
- [x] Create `references/authority-and-freshness.md`.
- [x] Create `references/prompt-and-model-governance.md`.
- [x] Create `references/donor-migration.md`.
- [ ] Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines and make it the MOC.

## Registries / schemas
- [x] Authority record schema.
- [x] Agent report schema.
- [x] Evidence reference schema.
- [x] Prompt reference schema.
- [x] Managed action schema.
- [x] Seed system registry.
- [x] Seed capability registry.
- [x] Seed integration registry.
- [x] Seed donor registry.
- [x] Seed plans registry.
- [ ] Seed agents registry. Prefer Herald-derived projection; add only if an agent-class registry proves necessary.

## Reporting / coordination
- [ ] Claim event.
- [ ] Progress checkpoint.
- [ ] Blocked event.
- [ ] Claim release.
- [x] Completion receipt projection and validation.
- [ ] Handoff receipt.
- [x] Stale claim detection from live Herald writer locks.
- [x] Collision detection from explicit Herald writer-lock paths.
- [x] Herald adapter/normalization for current + legacy thread shapes.

## Runtime projection
- [ ] BrainTrace projection.
- [ ] GenerationRequest/ContextManifest/ToolReceipt projection.
- [ ] ContentBuild/Project projection.
- [ ] Vault/Asset refs.
- [ ] Outcome/evaluation/learning refs.
- [ ] Prompt/model provenance joins.

## Health / CI
- [x] Multi-registry audit coverage.
- [x] Live Herald claim ingestion for stale-lock detection.
- [~] JSON schema validation. Record-level validation is enforced; full JSON Schema engine validation remains open.
- [ ] Broken docs refs.
- [x] Duplicate owner detection by bounded current concern.
- [ ] stale audited-main detection.
- [ ] reachability audit.
- [ ] writer-less ledger/store detection.
- [ ] direct provider bypass detection.
- [ ] analytics-canon bypass detection.
- [x] Unclosed/stale writer-lock detection.
- [x] Explicit terminal-thread completion without PROVEN receipt.
- [ ] prompt provenance coverage.

## Brain Hub UI
- [ ] Overview.
- [ ] Systems.
- [ ] Agents & Runs.
- [ ] Prompts.
- [ ] Plans.
- [ ] Evidence & Traces.
- [ ] Knowledge & Learning.
- [ ] Audit.
- [ ] Health.
- [ ] Responsive/state certification.

## Public agent-readiness track
- [ ] Root llms.txt.
- [ ] Decide public-safe llms-full.txt.
- [ ] Improve AGENTS.md structure.
- [ ] sitemap.xml.
- [ ] improve sitemap.md.
- [ ] canonical/meta/OG/JSON-LD.
- [ ] static/SSR public text.
- [ ] Markdown alternates/frontmatter/content negotiation where appropriate.
- [ ] Re-run Agent Ready scan and preserve score delta.

## Final certification
- [ ] blind-agent test passes.
- [ ] trigger boundary tests pass.
- [ ] no competing AI governor/Brain introduced.
- [ ] all current AI work has a claim/receipt path.
- [ ] all canonical records expose freshness/main SHA.
- [ ] all historical docs have explicit successors.
- [ ] read-only AI Systems management workspace verified before any managed action is enabled.
