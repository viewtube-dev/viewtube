# ViewTube One-Goal Status Ledger

**Transition projection:** exact task lifecycle authority is `docs/governance/TASK_AUTHORITY.md`; completion doctrine is `docs/architecture/PRODUCT_COMPLETION_CONSTITUTION.md`. This ledger remains a temporary human-readable projection until Task Index VNext canonical storage/writer is established.  
**Rule:** update this projection after meaningful implementation/verification slices. Do not mark DONE without evidence.

| ID | Workstream | Task | Priority | Status | Depends on | Evidence / next action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| VT-001 | Analytics | Define typed MetricComparabilityPolicy | P0 | DONE | — | Canonical policy now lives in analytics-canon with legacy compatibility re-export; 7/7 policy tests passed during Evidence convergence and VT-023 consumes it in Algorithm evaluation. |
| VT-002 | Publishing | Define ApprovedPublishSnapshot schema/hash | P0 | VERIFYING | — | PR #420 merged; immutable schema/hash + tamper tests are on main. Branch CI was obscured by Vercel build-rate limits; durable persistence remains VT-014. |
| VT-003 | Brain | Resolve active Project/ContentBuild context uniformly | P0 | VERIFYING | — | BrainRuntime surfaces supply active Project + ContentBuild identity through the bounded `BrainProjectContext` adapter with focused tests. Remaining gate: prove uniform supply across non-dashboard BrainRuntime consumers before DONE. |
| VT-004 | Brain | Build canonical Opportunity evidence feed | P0 | VERIFYING | VT-003 | Canonical Brain evidence deterministically produces provenance/confidence-bounded Opportunity evidence and joins Anomaly + Opportunity + Channel + Project in Algorithm Intelligence. Remaining gate: certify the shared production feed across runtime/widget consumers. |
| VT-005 | Reliability | Define cross-system correlation/idempotency envelope | P0 | READY | — | use existing event contracts; avoid second event store |
| VT-006 | Outcomes | Map producer families to existing ledgers/events | P0 | READY | VT-005 | Publisher/Project/Comment/Editor/Experiment |
| VT-007 | Outcomes | Publisher outcome writers | P1 | NOT_STARTED | VT-006 | preserve publish transaction/contentBuild identity |
| VT-008 | Outcomes | Project workflow outcome writers | P1 | NOT_STARTED | VT-006 | complete/abandon/decision lineage |
| VT-009 | Outcomes | Comment/community outcome writers | P1 | NOT_STARTED | VT-006 | no single-comment durable learning |
| VT-010 | Outcomes | Editor/render/export outcome writers | P1 | NOT_STARTED | VT-006 | join final render to ContentBuild |
| VT-011 | Outcomes | Experiment/package-selection outcome writers | P1 | NOT_STARTED | VT-006 | exact variant IDs |
| VT-012 | Evaluation | Audit evaluation target coverage | P1 | NOT_STARTED | VT-001,VT-006 | measurable or explicit non-measurable |

| VT-016 | Publishing | Retry/recovery/idempotency certification | P0 | NOT_STARTED | VT-005,VT-015 | interrupted publish fixtures |
| VT-017 | Post-publish | Write YouTube binding/lifecycle checkpoints to ContentBuild | P1 | NOT_STARTED | VT-015 | same identity survives publish |
| VT-018 | Post-publish | Analytics checkpoint → evaluation bridge | P1 | NOT_STARTED | VT-001,VT-017 | exact used variants |
| VT-019 | Brain | Classify/fix implicit readBrainUserControls() scope | P1 | READY | — | explicit channel when known |
| VT-020 | Brain | Migrate Hook Generator through canonical generation/runtime | P1 | NOT_STARTED | — | parity first, then shrink allowlist |
| VT-021 | Brain | Migrate Script Architect through canonical generation/runtime | P1 | NOT_STARTED | VT-020 | parity first |
| VT-022 | Brain | Build versioned AI regression/evaluation corpus | P1 | NOT_STARTED | VT-003,VT-004 | evidence/missingness/tool-selection cases |
| VT-023 | Analytics | Integrate MetricComparabilityPolicy into evaluation | P0 | DONE | VT-001 | PR #511: canonical observations/baselines carry source-field metric semantics; incompatible window/unit/entity/format/aggregation/availability comparisons fail closed as insufficient_data. 7/7 AlgorithmEvaluationEngine + 6/6 CanonicalAlgorithmEvaluation tests pass; production build/focused/source/smoke green. |
| VT-024 | Analytics | Integrate comparability into visual/experiment consumers | P1 | NOT_STARTED | VT-001 | structured UI incompatibility reasons |
| VT-025 | Analytics | Retire legacy selectors/cache consumers | P1 | IN_PROGRESS | — | Analytics master records remaining debt |
| VT-026 | Data Visuals | Retire controllerSpec/legacy preview compatibility | P2 | IN_PROGRESS | VT-025 | reachability zero before deletion |
| VT-027 | Data Visuals | Complete controller vocabulary/orientation/mark-scale migration | P2 | IN_PROGRESS | — | certify modules |
| VT-028 | Analytics UI | Portal Master Data transfer menus | P2 | READY | — | current toolbox table lacks createPortal |

| VT-030 | Editor | Preview/final-render golden parity fixtures | P1 | IN_PROGRESS | VT-029 | PR #417 unified visual-frame semantics, easing, transforms, crop, ordering and media fit with deterministic fixtures. Remaining: template/asset render parity, audio-critical parity, desktop FX host and generated capability matrix. |
| VT-031 | Editor | Four-layout runtime certification | P1 | NOT_STARTED | VT-030 | device orientation × project aspect |
| VT-032 | UI | Audit remaining bespoke controls vs canonical primitives | P2 | IN_PROGRESS | — | PR #430 moved Video Manager onto canonical primitives and added Mini SubToolbox/Labeled fields/Video Selector; continue remaining production surfaces. |
| VT-033 | UI | Remove nested duplicate shells/intrinsic sizing defects | P2 | IN_PROGRESS | VT-032 | PR #430 removed redundant Video Manager shells and repaired portrait clipping/spacing; continue Studio/Projects/dashboard certification rather than reopening Video Manager structure. |
| VT-034 | Reliability | Persistence schema/channel/project namespace audit | P1 | NOT_STARTED | — | distinguish cache vs truth |
| VT-035 | Reliability | Add correlation IDs across creator loop | P1 | NOT_STARTED | VT-005 | Brain→build→publish→evaluation |

| VT-041 | Agent OS | Mirror material status/decisions to Create State | P1 | IN_PROGRESS | VT-039 | Create State world model exists; PRs #421-424 add repository-native AI governance/claims/receipts. Keep Create State as continuity mirror, not repository truth. |
| VT-042 | Agent OS | Add stale-status/current-main audit routine | P1 | IN_PROGRESS | VT-039 | PR #423 validator detects stale active claims, owner conflicts and missing source paths; extend this pattern to One-Goal task freshness/current-main evidence. |
| VT-043 | Cleanup | Audit direct provider reachability | P2 | NOT_STARTED | VT-020,VT-021 | shrink allowlist |
| VT-044 | Cleanup | Audit duplicate state/mutation owners | P2 | NOT_STARTED | major migrations | Projects/editor/analytics/package |
