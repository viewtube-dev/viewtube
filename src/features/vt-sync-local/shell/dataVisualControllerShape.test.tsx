/**
 * The controller each registered visual actually renders.
 *
 * Phase 0 of `docs/migration/data-visual-controller-unification-plan.md`: the
 * plan changes row order, row count, width and density, and those four things
 * are decided in several places at once — partly by the module, partly by
 * whichever shell it was rendered through. `AnalyticsVisualShell` in particular
 * reorders every dropdown to the end, injects a `statement` row and truncates
 * to four, while a module rendering `SubToolboxChartModule` directly gets none
 * of that. Nothing recorded which modules were affected.
 *
 * This records it. Every later phase must leave this snapshot alone except
 * where the phase says otherwise, and then the diff is the review.
