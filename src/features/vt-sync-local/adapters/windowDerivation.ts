/**
 * Derive time-window rows from day- or month-grained history.
 *
 * Day-grained datasets (daily metrics, traffic x day, monthly metrics) are
 * stored as lifetime history, so every 7/28/90/365 window they can answer is
 * already sitting in IndexedDB. Deriving those windows locally costs ZERO
 * additional YouTube Analytics requests — the plan's "class A" datasets.
 *
 * Aggregation follows the authoritative metric contract rather than a local
 * guess: "sum" metrics add, "weighted-rate" metrics weight by views (or an
 * explicit weight metric), and "calculated-rate" metrics are recomputed from
 * their numerator and denominator after aggregation, because averaging a rate
 * across days is not the same as the rate over the period.
 *
 * See docs/migration/TIME_WINDOW_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_2026-09-11.md §1 and §5.3.
