// Route prefetching keyed off nav intent (hover, focus, touchstart).
//
// AppRoutes.tsx declares every top-level view with React.lazy(() => import(...)),
// which means their JS chunks aren't fetched until the route actually mounts.
// This module holds a lightweight parallel registry of the same import
// factories so the nav shell can *warm up* a chunk the moment a user shows
// intent — the browser fetches the chunk in the background, and by the time
// the user releases the click, the module is already resolved and the route
// mounts effectively instantly.
//
// Each factory is invoked at most once per session (Vite dedupes module
// requests, but we also gate on a Set to avoid re-invoking the promise chain).
// Add-in cost is a few dozen bytes of extra JS in the nav chunk.
